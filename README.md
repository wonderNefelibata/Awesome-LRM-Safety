| 2025-06-23 | [ReasonFlux-PRM: Trajectory-Aware PRMs for Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18896v1) | Jiaru Zou, Ling Yang et al. | Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment. Projects: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/ReasonFlux |

Evaluating Exploratory, Compositional, and Transformative Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18880v1) | Yiyou Sun, Shawn Hu et al. | Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity: (1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3) Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency. |
| 2025-06-23 | [LongWriter-Zero: Mastering Ultra-Long Text Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18841v1) | Yuhao Wu, Yushi Bai et al. | Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on ''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B, consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under https://huggingface.co/THU-KEG/LongWriter-Zero-32B |
| 2025-06-23 | [Regular Model Checking for Systems with Effectively Regular Reachability Relation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18833v1) | Javier Esparza, Valentin Krasotin | Regular model checking is a well-established technique for the verification of regular transition systems (RTS): transition systems whose initial configurations and transition relation can be effectively encoded as regular languages. In 2008, To and Libkin studied RTSs in which the reachability relation (the reflexive and transitive closure of the transition relation) is also effectively regular, and showed that the recurrent reachability problem (whether a regular set $L$ of configurations is reached infinitely often) is polynomial in the size of RTS and the transducer for the reachability relation. We extend the work of To and Libkin by studying the decidability and complexity of verifying almost-sure reachability and recurrent reachability -- that is, whether $L$ is reachable or recurrently reachable w.p. 1. We then apply our results to the more common case in which only a regular overapproximation of the reachability relation is available. In particular, we extend recent complexity results on verifying safety using regular abstraction frameworks -- a technique recently introduced by Czerner, the authors, and Welzel-Mohr -- to liveness and almost-sure properties. |
| 2025-06-23 | [ConciseHint: Boosting Efficient Reasoning via Continuous Concise Hints during Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18810v1) | Siao Tang, Xinyin Ma et al. | Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Existing LLMs Are Not Self-Consistent For Simple Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18781v1) | Zhenru Lin, Jiawen Tao et al. | Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency -- no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building more reliable and interpretable AI. The code and data are available at https://github.com/scorpio-nova/llm-self-consistency. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Safety-Aware Optimal Scheduling for Autonomous Masonry Construction using Collaborative Heterogeneous Aerial Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18697v1) | Marios-Nektarios Stamatopoulos, Shridhar Velhal et al. | This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety. The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation. The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety during the construction process. |
| 2025-06-23 | [NOVA: Navigation via Object-Centric Visual Autonomy for High-Speed Target Tracking in Unstructured GPS-Denied Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18689v1) | Alessandro Saviolo, Giuseppe Loianno | Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions. We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full 6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame. To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions. |
| 2025-06-23 | [ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18631v1) | Chenxing Wei, Jiarui Yu et al. | DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Crowdsourcing eHMI Designs: A Participatory Approach to Autonomous Vehicle-Pedestrian Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18605v1) | Ronald Cumbal, Didem Gurdur Broo et al. | As autonomous vehicles become more integrated into shared human environments, effective communication with road users is essential for ensuring safety. While previous research has focused on developing external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to facilitate these interactions, we argue that involving users in the early creative stages can help address key challenges in the development of this technology. To explore this, our study adopts a participatory, crowd-sourced approach to gather user-generated ideas for eHMI designs. Participants were first introduced to fundamental eHMI concepts, equipping them to sketch their own design ideas in response to scenarios with varying levels of perceived risk. An initial pre-study with 29 participants showed that while they actively engaged in the process, there was a need to refine task objectives and encourage deeper reflection. To address these challenges, a follow-up study with 50 participants was conducted. The results revealed a strong preference for autonomous vehicles to communicate their awareness and intentions using lights (LEDs and projections), symbols, and text. Participants' sketches prioritized multi-modal communication, directionality, and adaptability to enhance clarity, consistently integrating familiar vehicle elements to improve intuitiveness. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Virtual failure assessment diagrams for hydrogen transmission pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18554v1) | J. Wijnen, J. Parker et al. | We combine state-of-the-art thermo-metallurgical welding process modelling with coupled diffusion-elastic-plastic phase field fracture simulations to predict the failure states of hydrogen transport pipelines. This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Security Assessment of DeepSeek and GPT Series Models against Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18543v1) | Xiaodong Wu, Xiangman Li et al. | The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns over their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, i.e., adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms and elicit harmful or policy-violating outputs. While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive evaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic jailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack strategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and semantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness against optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly higher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In contrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety alignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral analysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial prompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal behaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between architectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure deployment of open-source LLMs. |
| 2025-06-23 | [How Robust is Model Editing after Fine-Tuning? An Empirical Study on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18428v1) | Feng He, Zhenyang Liu et al. | Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa, the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies, emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and alignment properties. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Improving precision of cumulative incidence estimates in randomized controlled trials with external controls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18415v1) | Zehao Su, Helene C. W. Rytgaard et al. | Augmenting the control arm in clinical trials with external data can improve statistical power for demonstrating treatment effects. In many time-to-event outcome trials, participants are subject to truncation by death. Direct application of methods for competing risks analysis on the joint data may introduce bias, for example, due to covariate shifts between the populations. In this work, we consider transportability of the conditional cause-specific hazard of the event of interest under the control treatment. Under this assumption, we derive semiparametric efficiency bounds of causal cumulative incidences. This allows for quantification of the theoretical efficiency gain from incorporating the external controls. We propose triply robust estimators that can achieve the efficiency bounds, where the trial controls and external controls are made comparable through time-specific weights in a martingale integral. We conducted a simulation study to show the precision gain of the proposed fusion estimators compared to their counterparts without utilizing external controls. As a real data application, we used two cardiovascular outcome trials conducted to assess the safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists. Incorporating the external controls from one trial into the other, we observed a decrease in the standard error of the treatment effects on adverse non-fatal cardiovascular events with all-cause death as the competing risk. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v1) | Anja Deliƒá, Matej Grciƒá et al. | Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Robotic Manipulation of a Rotating Chain with Bottom End Fixed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18355v1) | Qi Jing Chen, Shilin Shan et al. | This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation modes. The concepts explored in our work has critical applications in ensuring safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations. |
| 2025-06-23 | [NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18325v1) | Yu Xie, Chengjie Zeng et al. | The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse, including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence, discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications, this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants: PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics, effectively balancing safety and usability. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Supporting Car-Following Behavior through V2V-Based Beyond-Visual-Range Information Display](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18308v1) | Feiqi Gu, Zhixiong Wang et al. | Rear-end collisions constituted a large portion of crashes on the road, despite efforts to mitigate rear-end collisions, such as forward collision warnings. The chance of rear-end collisions is closely related to drivers' car-following (CF) behaviors in the traffic flow. Given that drivers may rely on more than the information of the direct lead vehicle (DLV) when making CF decisions, expanding drivers' perceptual range by providing beyond-visual-range (BVR) information based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication may enhance CF safety. Thus, four different human-machine interfaces (HMIs) providing various types of BVR information in CF events were designed, including Brake-HMI showing only brake action of indirect lead vehicles (ILV), Dis-HMI and THW-HMI showing the relative distance and time headway between the ILV and DLV, respectively, and Video-HMI showing the live-stream video of ILV from the perspective of DLV. A driving simulator experiment with 40 participants was conducted to evaluate the impact of BVR-based HMI on driving safety in CF events. We found that, in general, BVR information could improve CF safety without overloading drivers and compromising their visual attention allocation strategies, particularly among novice drivers, by enabling quicker brake responses and increasing time headway and time-to-collision in brake events. The Brake-HMI yielded the safest performance in chain brake events, whereas Video-HMI increased attentional demands without observable benefits. This research provides insights into enabling drivers' BVR perception based on V2V communication to enhance driving safety in CF scenarios. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Sharpening the Spear: Adaptive Expert-Guided Adversarial Attack Against DRL-based Autonomous Driving Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18304v1) | Junchao Fan, Xuyang Lei et al. | Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks, yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal. |
| 2025-06-23 | [Improvement on LiDAR-Camera Calibration Using Square Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18294v1) | Zhongyuan Li, Honggang Gou et al. | Precise sensor calibration is critical for autonomous vehicles as a prerequisite for perception algorithms to function properly. Rotation error of one degree can translate to position error of meters in target object detection at large distance, leading to improper reaction of the system or even safety related issues. Many methods for multi-sensor calibration have been proposed. However, there are very few work that comprehensively consider the challenges of the calibration procedure when applied to factory manufacturing pipeline or after-sales service scenarios. In this work, we introduce a fully automatic LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration algorithm based on targets that is fast, easy to deploy and robust to sensor noises such as missing data. The core of the method include: (1) an automatic multi-stage LiDAR board detection pipeline using only geometry information with no specific material requirement; (2) a fast coarse extrinsic parameter search mechanism that is robust to initial extrinsic errors; (3) a direct optimization algorithm that is robust to sensor noises. We validate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on data captured in real world scenarios. |
