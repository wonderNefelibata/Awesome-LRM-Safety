    "summary": "Safety and liveness are the two classical security properties of consensus protocols. Recent works have strengthened safety with accountability: should any safety violation occur, a sizable fraction of adversary nodes can be proven to be protocol violators. This paper studies to what extent analogous accountability guarantees are achievable for liveness. To reveal the full complexity of this question, we introduce an interpolation between the classical synchronous and partially-synchronous models that we call the $x$-partially-synchronous network model in which, intuitively, at most an $x$ fraction of the time steps in any sufficiently long interval are asynchronous (and, as with a partially-synchronous network, all time steps are synchronous following the passage of an unknown \"global stablization time\"). We prove a precise characterization of the parameter regime in which accountable liveness is achievable: if and only if $x < 1/2$ and $f < n/2$, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes and $f$ the number of nodes controlled by an adversary. We further refine the problem statement and our analysis by parameterizing by the number of violating nodes identified following a liveness violation, and provide evidence that the guarantees achieved by our protocol are near-optimal (as a function of $x$ and $f$). Our results provide rigorous foundations for liveness-accountability heuristics such as the \"inactivity leaks\" employed in Ethereum."

    "summary": "Conventional trajectory planning approaches for autonomous vehicles often assume a fixed vehicle model that remains constant regardless of the vehicle's location. This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time."

We introduce \\datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1).

Our approach leverages chain-of-thought prompting to generate detailed reasoning logs, which are subsequently distilled into structured, human-understandable logical rules. The pipeline integrates multiple enhancements - efficient data ingestion, a two-step refinement process, ensemble candidate sampling, simulated reinforcement learning scoring, and persistent memory - to ensure both stable decision-making and transparent output. Experimental evaluations on curated startup datasets demonstrate that our combined pipeline improves precision by 54% from 0.225 to 0.346 and accuracy by 50% from 0.46 to 0.70 compared to a standalone OpenAI o3 model. Notably, our model achieves over 2x the precision of a random classifier (16%). By combining state-of-the-art AI reasoning with explicit rule-based explanations, our method not only augments traditional decision-making processes but also facilitates expert intervention and continuous policy refinement. This work lays the foundation for the implementation of interpretable LLM-powered decision frameworks in high-stakes investment environments and other domains that require transparent and data-driven insights."

    "summary": "Hate speech detection is a crucial area of research in natural language processing, essential for ensuring online community safety. However, detecting implicit hate speech, where harmful intent is conveyed in subtle or indirect ways, remains a major challenge. Unlike explicit hate speech, implicit expressions often depend on context, cultural subtleties, and hidden biases, making them more challenging to identify consistently. Additionally, the interpretation of such speech is influenced by external knowledge and demographic biases, resulting in varied detection results across different language models. Furthermore, Large Language Models often show heightened sensitivity to toxic language and references to vulnerable groups, which can lead to misclassifications. This over-sensitivity results in false positives (incorrectly identifying harmless statements as hateful) and false negatives (failing to detect genuinely harmful content). Addressing these issues requires methods that not only improve detection precision but also reduce model biases and enhance robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, which utilizes in-context learning without requiring model fine-tuning. By adaptively retrieving demonstrations that focus on similar groups or those with the highest similarity scores, our approach enhances contextual comprehension. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. Implementation details and code are available at TBD."

The metric resembles the Schwarzschild solution in the classical limit. The departure from Schwarzschild at small scales is controlled by a single free parameter related to the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff of the theory. We investigated null and time-like geodesics around the AS metric, including circular orbits, photon rings and lensing effects. In particular we focused on the optical properties of thin accretion disks in the equatorial plane of the object and compared them with those of accretion disks in the Schwarzschild metric. We found that the radiation flux, luminosity, and efficiency of the accretion disk increase with the value of the free parameter. Using a spacetime generic open-source relativistic ray-tracing code, we simulate the K$\\alpha$ iron line profiles emitted by the disk and analyze their deviation from that of the Schwarzschild geometry."

    "summary": "Today's control systems are often characterized by modularity and safety requirements to handle complexity, resulting in hierarchical control structures. Although hierarchical model predictive control offers favorable properties, achieving a provably safe, yet modular design remains a challenge. This paper introduces a contract-based hierarchical control strategy to improve the performance of control systems facing challenges related to model inconsistency and independent controller design across hierarchies. We consider a setup where a higher-level controller generates references that affect the constraints of a lower-level controller, which is based on a soft-constrained MPC formulation. The optimal slack variables serve as the basis for a contract that allows the higher-level controller to assess the feasibility of the reference trajectory without exact knowledge of the model, constraints, and cost of the lower-level controller. To ensure computational efficiency while maintaining model confidentiality, we propose using an explicit function approximation, such as a neural network, to represent the cost of optimal slack values. The approach is tested for a hierarchical control setup consisting of a planner and a motion controller as commonly found in autonomous driving."

    "summary": "Extreme weather events, rare yet profoundly impactful, are often accompanied by severe conditions. Increasing global temperatures are poised to exacerbate these events, resulting in greater human casualties, economic losses, and ecological destruction. Complex global climate interactions, known as teleconnections, can lead to widespread repercussions triggered by localized extreme weather. Understanding these teleconnection patterns is crucial for weather forecasting, enhancing safety, and advancing climate science. Here, we employ climate network analysis to uncover teleconnection patterns associated with extreme temperature fluctuations, including both extreme warming and cooling events occurring on a daily basis. Our study results demonstrate that the distances of significant teleconnections initially conform to a power-law decay, signifying a decline in connectivity with distance. However, this power-law decay tendency breaks beyond a certain threshold distance, suggesting the existence of long-distance connections. Additionally, we uncover a greater prevalence of long-distance connectivity among extreme cooling events compared to extreme warming events. The global pattern of teleconnections is, in part, driven by the mechanism of Rossby waves, which serve as a rapid conduit for inducing correlated fluctuations in both pressure and temperature. These results enhance our understanding of the multiscale nature of climate teleconnections and hold significant implications for improving weather forecasting and assessing climate risks in a warming world."

    "summary": "Many existing digital triage systems are questionnaire-based, guiding patients to appropriate care levels based on information (e.g., symptoms, medical history, and urgency) provided by the patients answering questionnaires. Such a system often uses a deterministic model with predefined rules to determine care levels. It faces challenges with incomplete triage interviews since it can only assist patients who finish the process. In this study, we explore the use of machine learning (ML) to predict outcomes of unfinished interviews, aiming to enhance patient care and service quality. Predicting triage outcomes from incomplete data is crucial for patient safety and healthcare efficiency. Our findings show that decision-tree models, particularly LGBMClassifier and CatBoostClassifier, achieve over 80\\% accuracy in predicting outcomes from complete interviews while having a linear correlation between the prediction accuracy and interview completeness degree. For example, LGBMClassifier achieves 88,2\\% prediction accuracy for interviews with 100\\% completeness, 79,6\\% accuracy for interviews with 80\\% completeness, 58,9\\% accuracy for 60\\% completeness, and 45,7\\% accuracy for 40\\% completeness. The TabTransformer model demonstrated exceptional accuracy of over 80\\% for all degrees of completeness but required extensive training time, indicating a need for more powerful computational resources. The study highlights the linear correlation between interview completeness and predictive power of the decision-tree models."

In light of this, we propose SemDiff, a novel unrestricted adversarial attack that explores the semantic latent space of diffusion models for meaningful attributes, and devises a multi-attributes optimization approach to ensure attack success while maintaining the naturalness and imperceptibility of generated UAEs. We perform extensive experiments on four tasks on three high-resolution datasets, including CelebA-HQ, AFHQ and ImageNet. The results demonstrate that SemDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of attack success rate and imperceptibility. The generated UAEs are natural and exhibit semantically meaningful changes, in accord with the attributes' weights. In addition, SemDiff is found capable of evading different defenses, which further validates its effectiveness and threatening."

This provides potentially high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for stimulating the reasoning abilities of small-sized large language models (LLMs). To generate high-quality CoT data for different LLMs, we seek an efficient method for generating high-quality CoT data with LLM-Adaptive questiondifficulty levels. First, we grade the difficulty of the questions according to the reasoning ability of the LLMs themselves and construct a LLM-Adaptive question database. Second, we sample the problem database based on a distribution of difficulty levels of the questions and then use DeepSeek-R1 (671B) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) to generate the corresponding high-quality CoT data with correct answers. Thanks to the construction of CoT data with LLM-Adaptive difficulty levels, we have significantly reduced the cost of data generation and enhanced the efficiency of model supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Finally, we have validated the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method in the fields of complex mathematical competitions and code generation tasks. Notably, with only 2k high-quality mathematical CoT data, our ZMath-32B surpasses DeepSeek-Distill-32B in math reasoning task. Similarly, with only 2k high-quality code CoT data, our ZCode-32B surpasses DeepSeek-Distill-32B in code reasoning tasks."

This paper presents a novel approach combining a graph neural network-based exploration greedy policy with a safety shield to ensure safe navigation goal selection. The network is trained using reinforcement learning and the proximal policy optimization algorithm to maximize exploration efficiency while reducing the safety shield interventions. However, if the policy selects an infeasible action, the safety shield intervenes to choose the best feasible alternative, ensuring system consistency. Moreover, this paper proposes a reward function that includes a potential field based on the agent's proximity to unexplored regions and the expected information gain from reaching them. Overall, the approach investigated in this paper merges the benefits of the adaptability of reinforcement learning-driven exploration policies and the guarantee ensured by explicit safety mechanisms.

Unlike prior work, we identify a new time-exciting threat model against IVN. These attacks inject malicious messages that exhibit a time-exciting effect, gradually manipulating network traffic to disrupt vehicle operations and compromise safety-critical functions. We systematically analyze the characteristics of the threat: dynamism, time-exciting impact, and low prior knowledge dependency. To validate its practicality, we replicate the attack on a real Advanced Driver Assistance System via Controller Area Network (CAN), exploiting Unified Diagnostic Service vulnerabilities and proposing four attack strategies. While CAN's integrity checks mitigate attacks, Ethernet migration (e.g., DoIP/SOME/IP) introduces new surfaces. We further investigate the feasibility of time-exciting threat under SOME/IP. To detect time-exciting threat, we introduce MDHP-Net, leveraging Multi-Dimentional Hawkes Process (MDHP) and temporal and message-wise feature extracting structures. Meanwhile, to estimate MDHP parameters, we developed the first GPU-optimized gradient descent solver for MDHP (MDHP-GDS). These modules significantly improves the detection rate under time-exciting attacks in multi-ECU IVN system. To address data scarcity, we release STEIA9, the first open-source dataset for time-exciting attacks, covering 9 Ethernet-based attack scenarios.

    "summary": "Kidney stones can cause severe pain and complications such as chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), which uses laser lithotripsy to fragment stones for removal via a ureteroscope, is widely adopted due to its safety and effectiveness. However, conventional fragment removal methods using basketing and vacuum-assisted aspiration are inefficient, as they can capture only 1 to 3 fragments (1--3\\,mm in size) per pass, often requiring dozens to hundreds of ureteroscope passes during a single procedure to completely remove the fragments. These limitations lead to prolonged procedures and residual fragments that contribute to high recurrence rates. To address these limitations, we present a novel spinner device that enables ultra-efficient fragment removal through spinning-induced localized suction. The spinner generates a three-dimensional spiral and circulating flow field that dislodges and draws fragments into its cavity even from distances over 20\\,mm, eliminating the need to chase fragments. It can capture over 60 fragments (0.5--2\\,mm) or over 15 larger fragments (2--3\\,mm) in a single pass, significantly improving removal efficiency. In this work, the spinner design is optimized via computational fluid dynamics to maximize suction performance. \\textit{In vitro} testing demonstrates near 100\\% capture rates for up to 60 fragments in a single operation and superior large-distance capture efficacy compared to vacuum-assisted methods. \\textit{Ex vivo} testing of the integrated spinner-ureteroscope system in a porcine kidney confirmed its high performance by capturing 45 fragments in just 4 seconds during a single pass and achieving complete fragment clearance within a few passes."

The algorithm features two new mechanisms, node reduction and Bezier interpolation, to ensure the feasibility and optimality of the paths generated. Importantly, the interpolated paths are proven to meet the safety and dynamics constraints imposed by obstacles and the UAVs. A number of simulations, comparisons, and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that MultiRRT can generate collision-free paths for multiple UAVs to reach their goals with better scores in path length and smoothness metrics than state-of-the-art RRT variants including Theta-RRT, FN-RRT, RRT*, and RRT*-Smart. The generated paths are also tested in practical flights with real UAVs to evaluate their validity for cooperative tasks.

    "summary": "We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel quality control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in \"driving on the edge\" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness."

System operators implement PSPS to balance wildfire mitigation efforts through de-energization of transmission lines against the risk of widespread blackouts modeled with load shedding.   Existing approaches do not incorporate decision-dependent wildfire-driven failure probabilities, as modeling outage scenario probabilities requires incorporating high-order polynomial terms in the objective. This paper uses distribution shaping to develop an efficient MILP problem representation of the distributionally robust PSPS problem. Building upon the author's prior work, the wildfire risk of operating a transmission line is a function of the probability of a wildfire-driven outage and its subsequent expected impact in acres burned.   A day-ahead unit commitment and line de-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the trade-off between total cost and wildfire risk at different levels of distributional robustness, parameterized by a level of distributional dissimilarity $\\kappa$. We perform simulations on the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system."

    "summary": "The fast development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers growing opportunities to further improve sequential recommendation systems. Yet for some practitioners, integrating LLMs to their existing base recommendation systems raises questions about model interpretability, transparency and related safety. To partly alleviate challenges from these questions, we propose guided embedding refinement, a method that carries out a guided and interpretable usage of LLM to enhance the embeddings associated with the base recommendation system. Instead of directly using LLMs as the backbone of sequential recommendation systems, we utilize them as auxiliary tools to emulate the sales logic of recommendation and generate guided embeddings that capture domain-relevant semantic information on interpretable attributes. Benefiting from the strong generalization capabilities of the guided embedding, we construct refined embedding by using the guided embedding and reduced-dimension version of the base embedding. We then integrate the refined embedding into the recommendation module for training and inference. A range of numerical experiments demonstrate that guided embedding is adaptable to various given existing base embedding models, and generalizes well across different recommendation tasks. The numerical results show that the refined embedding not only improves recommendation performance, achieving approximately $10\\%$ to $50\\%$ gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Recall rate, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), but also enhances interpretability, as evidenced by case studies."

By directly incorporating uncertainties from environmental conditions and spacecraft dynamics, an optimal sequence of actions is computed that maximizes expected rewards and strictly enforces safety constraints. Numerical experiments on the GRACE-FO mission demonstrate robust performance under uncertainties while providing probabilistic safety guarantees, offering a reliable solution for autonomous spacecraft operations."

However, generally, control strategies often neglect these physical limitations, leading to potential instability, degraded performance, or even system failure when deployed on real-world systems. This paper addresses the control design problem for a class of nonlinear systems under both actuator saturation and output constraints. First, a smooth asymmetric saturation model (a more generic representative of practical scenarios) is proposed to model actuator saturation, which ensures that the control inputs always remain confined within a predefined set to ensure safety. Based on the proposed model, we develop a nonlinear control framework that guarantees output tracking while ensuring that system output remains confined to the predefined set. Later, we integrate this design with the constrained output tracking control problem, wherein we show that the system output tracks its desired trajectory by simultaneously satisfying input and output constraints. The global stabilization of the tracking error is achieved in the presence of input constraints, while semi-global stabilization is achieved in the presence of both input and output constraints. Additionally, we rigorously establish the boundedness of all closed-loop signals under the proposed design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling asymmetric constraints while achieving desirable tracking performance."

To bridge this gap, we propose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated learning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time code execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an automated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time code execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools based on outcome feedback. ReTool employs a systematic training framework, beginning with synthetic cold-start data generation to produce code-augmented long-form reasoning traces for fine-tuning base models. Subsequent RL training leverages task outcomes as rewards to iteratively refine the model's tool use strategy, enabling autonomous discovery of optimal tool invocation patterns without human priors. Experiments on the challenging MATH Olympiad benchmark AIME demonstrate ReTool's superiority: Our 32B model achieves 67% accuracy with 400 training steps, outperforming text-based RL baseline (40% accuracy, 1080 steps) in efficiency and performance. Remarkably, ReTool-32B attains 72.5% accuracy in extended settings, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview by 27.9%. Further analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as code self-correction, signaling an ''aha moment'' in which the model autonomously masters adaptive tool use. These findings highlight the promise of outcome-driven tool integration for advancing complex mathematical reasoning and offer new insights into hybrid neuro-symbolic systems."

Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training."

Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods."

Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable, auto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult.

This work proposes a hybrid architecture combining low-level Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with locally deployed Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making and Human Machine Interaction (HMI). The DecisionxLLM module evaluates robotic state information against natural language instructions to ensure adherence to desired driving behavior. The MPCxLLM module then adjusts MPC parameters based on LLM-generated insights, achieving control adaptability while preserving the safety and constraint guarantees of traditional MPC systems. Further, to enable efficient on-board deployment and to eliminate dependency on cloud connectivity, we shift processing to the on-board computing platform: We propose an approach that exploits Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, and quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that these enhancements yield significant improvements in reasoning accuracy by up to 10.45%, control adaptability by as much as 52.2%, and up to 10.5x increase in computational efficiency (tokens/s), validating the proposed framework's practicality for real-time deployment even on down-scaled robotic platforms.

The performance of models across the text-generation metrics varied: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and o1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with DeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest (6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized justifications."

    "summary": "The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) with recommender systems (RecSys) has dramatically advanced personalized recommendations and drawn extensive attention. Despite the impressive progress, the safety of LLM-based RecSys against backdoor attacks remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we raise a new problem: Can a backdoor with a specific trigger be injected into LLM-based Recsys, leading to the manipulation of the recommendation responses when the backdoor trigger is appended to an item's title? To investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based RecSys under backdoor attacks, we propose a new attack framework termed Backdoor Injection Poisoning for RecSys (BadRec). BadRec perturbs the items' titles with triggers and employs several fake users to interact with these items, effectively poisoning the training set and injecting backdoors into LLM-based RecSys. Comprehensive experiments reveal that poisoning just 1% of the training data with adversarial examples is sufficient to successfully implant backdoors, enabling manipulation of recommendations. To further mitigate such a security threat, we propose a universal defense strategy called Poison Scanner (P-Scanner). Specifically, we introduce an LLM-based poison scanner to detect the poisoned items by leveraging the powerful language understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. A trigger augmentation agent is employed to generate diverse synthetic triggers to guide the poison scanner in learning domain-specific knowledge of the poisoned item detection task. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed P-Scanner."

In this work, we propose TCBS-Attack, a novel query-based black-box jailbreak attack that searches for tokens located near the decision boundaries defined by text and image checkers. By iteratively optimizing tokens near these boundaries, TCBS-Attack generates semantically coherent adversarial prompts capable of bypassing multiple defensive layers in T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks across various T2I models, including securely trained open-source models and commercial online services like DALL-E 3. TCBS-Attack achieves an ASR-4 of 45\\% and an ASR-1 of 21\\% on jailbreaking full-chain T2I models, significantly surpassing baseline methods."

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective tool for guaranteeing safety; however, manually designing them for specific applications remains a significant challenge.

This paper introduces a novel class of neural CBFs that leverages a physics-inspired neural network framework by incorporating Zubov's Partial Differential Equation (PDE) within the context of safety. This approach provides a scalable methodology for synthesizing neural CBFs applicable to high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, by utilizing reciprocal CBFs instead of zeroing CBFs, the proposed framework allows for the specification of flexible, user-defined safe regions. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, we present case studies on three different systems: an inverted pendulum, autonomous ground navigation, and aerial navigation in obstacle-laden environments."

DRIFT provides high-resolution vehicle trajectories that include directional information, processed through video synchronization and orthomap alignment, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 81,699 vehicle trajectories. Through our DRIFT dataset, researchers can simultaneously analyze traffic at multiple scales - from individual vehicle maneuvers like lane-changes and safety metrics such as time-to-collision to aggregate network flow dynamics across interconnected urban intersections. The DRIFT dataset is structured to enable immediate use without additional preprocessing, complemented by open-source models for object detection and trajectory extraction, as well as associated analytical tools.

    "summary": "Reward comparisons are vital for evaluating differences in agent behaviors induced by a set of reward functions. Most conventional techniques utilize the input reward functions to learn optimized policies, which are then used to compare agent behaviors. However, learning these policies can be computationally expensive and can also raise safety concerns. Direct reward comparison techniques obviate policy learning but suffer from transition sparsity, where only a small subset of transitions are sampled due to data collection challenges and feasibility constraints. Existing state-of-the-art direct reward comparison methods are ill-suited for these sparse conditions since they require high transition coverage, where the majority of transitions from a given coverage distribution are sampled. When this requirement is not satisfied, a distribution mismatch between sampled and expected transitions can occur, leading to significant errors. This paper introduces the Sparsity Resilient Reward Distance (SRRD) pseudometric, designed to eliminate the need for high transition coverage by accommodating diverse sample distributions, which are common under transition sparsity. We provide theoretical justification for SRRD's robustness and conduct experiments to demonstrate its practical efficacy across multiple domains."

A large part of behavioural adoption is related to peoples' attitudes and perceptions. In this paper, we develop an adjusted behavioural framework, based on the UTAUT2 technology acceptance framework. We carry out an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to obtain attitudinal factors which we then use to perform a latent class cluster analysis (LCCA), with the goal of studying the potential adoption of SMM and to assess the various drivers and barriers as perceived by different user groups. Our findings suggest there are six distinct user groups with varying intention to use shared micromobility: Progressives, Conservatives, Hesitant participants, Bold innovators, Anxious observers and Skilled sceptics. Bold innovators and Progressives tend to be the most open to adopting SMM and are also able to do so. Hesitant participants would like to, but find it difficult or dangerous to use, while Skilled sceptics are capable and confident, but have limited intention of using it. Conservatives and Anxious observers are most negative about SMM, finding it difficult to use and dangerous. In general, factors relating to technological savviness, ease-of-use, physical safety and societal perception seem to be the biggest barriers to wider adoption. Younger, highly educated males are the group most likely and open to using shared micromobility, while older individuals with lower incomes and a lower level of education tend to be the least likely."

    "summary": "Recognizing safety violations in construction environments is critical yet remains underexplored in computer vision. Existing models predominantly rely on 2D object detection, which fails to capture the complexities of real-world violations due to: (i) an oversimplified task formulation treating violation recognition merely as object detection, (ii) inadequate validation under realistic conditions, (iii) absence of standardized baselines, and (iv) limited scalability from the unavailability of synthetic dataset generators for diverse construction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce Safe-Construct, the first framework that reformulates violation recognition as a 3D multi-view engagement task, leveraging scene-level worker-object context and 3D spatial understanding. We also propose the Synthetic Indoor Construction Site Generator (SICSG) to create diverse, scalable training data, overcoming data limitations. Safe-Construct achieves a 7.6% improvement over state-of-the-art methods across four violation types. We rigorously evaluate our approach in near-realistic settings, incorporating four violations, four workers, 14 objects, and challenging conditions like occlusions (worker-object, worker-worker) and variable illumination (back-lighting, overexposure, sunlight). By integrating 3D multi-view spatial understanding and synthetic data generation, Safe-Construct sets a new benchmark for scalable and robust safety monitoring in high-risk industries.

An RL-based safety filter monitors each GPT decision and overrides unsafe actions that could lead to battery depletion or duplicate visits, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Furthermore, a dual replay buffer mechanism helps both the GPT modules and the RL agent refine their strategies over time. Simulation results demonstrate that SafeGPT achieves higher delivery success rates compared to a GPT-only baseline, while substantially reducing battery consumption and travel distance.

    "summary": "Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks."

However, their unique architectural properties raise new challenges and opportunities in adversarial robustness. In particular, we observe that adversarial examples crafted on ViTs exhibit higher transferability compared to those crafted on CNNs, suggesting that ViTs contain structural characteristics favorable for transferable attacks. In this work, we investigate the role of computational redundancy in ViTs and its impact on adversarial transferability. Unlike prior studies that aim to reduce computation for efficiency, we propose to exploit this redundancy to improve the quality and transferability of adversarial examples. Through a detailed analysis, we identify two forms of redundancy, including the data-level and model-level, that can be harnessed to amplify attack effectiveness. Building on this insight, we design a suite of techniques, including attention sparsity manipulation, attention head permutation, clean token regularization, ghost MoE diversification, and test-time adversarial training. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-1k dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that our methods significantly outperform existing baselines in both transferability and generality across diverse model architectures."

We propose an infinite class of product programs, specifically designed with recursion in mind, that reduce the hypersafety verification of a recursive program to standard safety verification. For this, we combine insights from language theory and concurrency theory to propose an algorithmic solution for constructing an infinite class of recursive product programs. One key insight is that, using the simple theory of visibly pushdown languages, one can maintain the recursive structure of syntactic program alignments which is vital to constructing a new product program that can be viewed as a classic recursive program -- that is, one that can be executed on a single stack. Another key insight is that techniques from concurrency theory can be generalized to help define product programs based on the view that the parallel composition of individual recursive programs includes all possible alignments from which a sound set of alignments that faithfully preserve the satisfaction of the hypersafety property can be selected. On the practical side, we formulate a family of parametric canonical product constructions that are intuitive to programmers and can be used as building blocks to specify recursive product programs for the purpose of relational and hypersafety verification, with the idea that the right product program can be verified automatically using existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through an implementation and highly promising experimental results."

We compare reasoning-based fine-tuning, answer-only fine-tuning, and baseline instruction-tuned models across multiple small VLM families (Llama 3.2, Llava 1.5, and Qwen 2.5VL). Our results demonstrate that reasoning-based fine-tuning consistently outperforms alternatives, with Llama3.2-11B-reason achieving the highest performance.

Since the utility of most unsafe answers (e.g., bomb instructions) is hard to evaluate rigorously, we build new jailbreak evaluation sets with known ground truth answers, by aligning models to refuse questions related to benign and easy-to-evaluate topics (e.g., biology or math). Our evaluation of eight representative jailbreaks across five utility benchmarks reveals a consistent drop in model utility in jailbroken responses, which we term the jailbreak tax. For example, while all jailbreaks we tested bypass guardrails in models aligned to refuse to answer math, this comes at the expense of a drop of up to 92% in accuracy. Overall, our work proposes the jailbreak tax as a new important metric in AI safety, and introduces benchmarks to evaluate existing and future jailbreaks. We make the benchmark available at https://github.com/ethz-spylab/jailbreak-tax"

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can perform reasoning computations both internally within their latent space and externally by generating explicit token sequences like chains of thought. Significant progress in enhancing reasoning abilities has been made by scaling test-time compute. However, understanding and quantifying model-internal reasoning abilities - the inferential \"leaps\" models make between individual token predictions - remains crucial. This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to quantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by having LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through descriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial response token that is different from English, the benchmark language. This not only requires models to reason beyond their context window, but also to overrise their default tendency to respond in the same language as the prompt, thereby posing an additional cognitive strain. We evaluate a set of 18 LLMs, showing significant performance variations, with GPT-4.5 achieving the highest accuracy (74.7%), outperforming models like Grok-2 (67.2%), and Llama 3.1 405B (65.6%). Control experiments and difficulty scaling analyses suggest that while LLMs engage in internal reasoning, we cannot rule out heuristic exploitations under certain conditions, marking an area for future investigation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can \"think\" via latent-space computations, revealing model-internal inference strategies that need further understanding, especially regarding safety-related concerns such as covert planning, goal-seeking, or deception emerging without explicit token traces."

    "summary": "Controllable scene generation could reduce the cost of diverse data collection substantially for autonomous driving. Prior works formulate the traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers 540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in, sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation."

As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\\%. Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify."

Recent large language models (LLMs) have boosted performance by scaling test-time computation through long chain-of-thought reasoning. However, transformer-based models are inherently limited in extending context length due to their quadratic computational complexity and linear memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid linear RNN reasoning model, M1, built on the Mamba architecture, which allows memory-efficient inference. Our approach leverages a distillation process from existing reasoning models and is further enhanced through RL training. Experimental results on the AIME and MATH benchmarks show that M1 not only outperforms previous linear RNN models but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art Deepseek R1 distilled reasoning models at a similar scale. We also compare our generation speed with a highly performant general purpose inference engine, vLLM, and observe more than a 3x speedup compared to a same size transformer. With throughput speedup, we are able to achieve higher accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled transformer reasoning models under a fixed generation time budget using self-consistency voting. Overall, we introduce a hybrid Mamba reasoning model and provide a more effective approach to scaling test-time generation using self-consistency or long chain of thought reasoning."

However, such potential also raises concerns about the safety risks of LLM-driven persuasion, particularly their potential for unethical influence through manipulation, deception, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and many other harmful tactics. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of LLM persuasion safety through two critical aspects: (1) whether LLMs appropriately reject unethical persuasion tasks and avoid unethical strategies during execution, including cases where the initial persuasion goal appears ethically neutral, and (2) how influencing factors like personality traits and external pressures affect their behavior. To this end, we introduce PersuSafety, the first comprehensive framework for the assessment of persuasion safety which consists of three stages, i.e., persuasion scene creation, persuasive conversation simulation, and persuasion safety assessment. PersuSafety covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and 15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including failing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical persuasion strategies. Our study calls for more attention to improve safety alignment in progressive and goal-driven conversations such as persuasion."

Our work presents the first control evaluation performed in an agent environment. We construct BashBench, a dataset of 257 challenging multi-step system administration tasks, and evaluate whether various safety measures can prevent an adversarially constructed AI agent from covertly downloading and executing malicious code in this environment. This multi-step setting introduces new attack and defense dynamics, which we investigate in order to design novel control protocols that prevent safety failures without hindering the ability of non-malicious agents to perform useful work. We introduce a class of control protocols called resample protocols that dynamically take additional samples of certain actions. We find these protocols significantly improve on existing techniques by selectively blocking the AI agent from executing suspicious code and incriminating the agent by generating additional examples of dangerous behavior. We measure the tradeoff between attack prevention and usefulness; our best protocol combines resampling with analysis of previous steps, reducing the success rate of attacks from 58% to 7% at a 5% cost to the performance of a non-malicious agent."

We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function which drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which uses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both methods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system robustness.

The diffusion behavior of lithium ions in the contained polycrystalline solid-state electrolyte is crucial for battery function. While atomistic studies indicate that grain boundaries (GBs) and grain size significantly impact diffusivity, the corresponding effects are either neglected in simulations on larger scales or considered only under strong assumptions such as isotropy. Our approach considers the fully resolved crystalline structure with a parametrization aligned with the atomistic perspective to describe diffusion along and across GBs. The approach is embedded into a finite element simulation using a novel collapsed interface element based on an analytical description in thickness direction. Results are governed by different and potentially anisotropic diffusion coefficients in bulk and GB domains. The mesoscale response is derived using linear computational homogenization to capture large-scale effects. The novel collapsed interface description allows for a reconstruction of the 3D transport behavior within the GB domain without resolving it and is able to capture the relevant transport mechanisms such as channeling effects and concentration jumps. Grain size and GB volume fraction are expressed in terms of an affine parameter dependence and can be altered without any changes to geometry or mesh. Together with the observed dependence of the effective material response on the anisotropic GB parametrization, this leads to the identification of four distinct diffusion regimes, each with implications for the design of battery materials."

This operator compares the sum of all time steps for which its nested formula is true with a threshold. We present both a qualitative and a quantitative (robustness) semantics for CT-STL and prove both their soundness and completeness properties. We provide an efficient online monitoring algorithm for both semantics. Finally, we show the applicability of CT-STL in two case studies: specifying and monitoring cumulative temporal requirements for a microgrid and an artificial pancreas."

    "summary": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements."

However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation.

    "summary": "In the framework of asymptotic safety, we study quantum quadratic gravity in the presence of the Higgs field considered as non-separable from the vacuum. The theory flows to a high energy fixed point where the Higgs field is strongly coupled to gravity, its potential is symmetric, and the quadratic Weyl curvature coupling is large. The latter renders the ghost graviton an unstable high mass resonance which renders unitarity in the spirit of Lee-Week type theories. Furthermore, if the scalar graviton is tachyonic then there will be a low energy fixed point where tachyonic condensation leads to a new stable vacuum. At this fixed point the symmetry breaks and the Fermi scale emerges, and the behavior of the Higgs field is classical (not influenced by gravitational interaction). Gravity at the UV scale is purely quadratic whereas at the Fermi scale it is linear, and in the intermediate region both contributions are relevant. Thus, at the Fermi scale the quadratic curvature fields disappear through the ghost instability and tachyon condensation, giving rise to Einstein gravity and the electroweak phase transition."

    "summary": "Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various complex tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account. This task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches the deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during reinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning baselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation."

Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models."

However, visual reasoning, reasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored. Recent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this capability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related tasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the underlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the camera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a photo to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a deeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual comprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential for practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to evaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to numerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for vision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the importance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these results show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation tasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs with better visual reasoning."

In this paper, we introduce RealSafe-R1 as safety-aligned versions of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models. To train these models, we construct a dataset of 15k safety-aware reasoning trajectories generated by DeepSeek-R1, under explicit instructions for expected refusal behavior. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies demonstrate the models' improvements, which are shown in their safety guardrails against both harmful queries and jailbreak attacks. Importantly, unlike prior safety alignment efforts that often compromise reasoning performance, our method preserves the models' reasoning capabilities by maintaining the training data within the original distribution of generation.

However, despite their success, they often face calibration issues, particularly in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare, where unreliable predictions can have serious consequences. Recent research has started to improve model calibration from the view of the classifier. However, the exploration of designing the classifier to solve the model calibration problem is insufficient. Let alone most of the existing methods ignore the calibration errors arising from underconfidence. In this work, we propose a novel method by balancing learnable and ETF classifiers to solve the overconfidence or underconfidence problem for model Calibration named BalCAL. By introducing a confidence-tunable module and a dynamic adjustment method, we ensure better alignment between model confidence and its true accuracy. Extensive experimental validation shows that ours significantly improves model calibration performance while maintaining high predictive accuracy, outperforming existing techniques. This provides a novel solution to the calibration challenges commonly encountered in deep learning."

Typically, current open-source MLLMs rely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful generations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for multi-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to vision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize a carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while the specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset remain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap primarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response quality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution to boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the key factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small set of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear rejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for labor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can still be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection data exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not lost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction finetuning. Simply correcting the underlying data bias could narrow the safety gap in the vision domain."

We present a comprehensive benchmark comparing judging biases between LLMs and LRMs across both subjective preference-alignment datasets and objective fact-based datasets. Through investigation of bandwagon, authority, position, and distraction biases, we uncover four key findings: (1) despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, LRMs remain susceptible to the above biases; (2) LRMs demonstrate better robustness than LLMs specifically on fact-related datasets; (3) LRMs exhibit notable position bias, preferring options in later positions; and (4) we identify a novel \"superficial reflection bias\" where phrases mimicking reasoning (e.g., \"wait, let me think...\") significantly influence model judgments. To address these biases, we design and evaluate three mitigation strategies: specialized system prompts that reduce judging biases by up to 19\\% in preference alignment datasets and 14\\% in fact-related datasets, in-context learning that provides up to 27\\% improvement on preference tasks but shows inconsistent results on factual tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that reduces biases by up to 10\\% in preference datasets and 16\\% in fact-related datasets, with self-reflection proving particularly effective for LRMs. Our work provides crucial insights for developing more reliable LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, especially as LRMs become increasingly deployed as automated judges."

This formulation can be viewed as the dual of the SDP relaxation for a problem formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). While SDP relaxations of QCQPs generally provide approximate solutions with some gaps, this work focuses on tight SDP relaxations that provide exact solutions to the QCQP for single-layer NNs. Specifically, we analyze tightness conditions in three cases: (i) NNs with a single neuron, (ii) single-layer NNs with an ellipsoidal input set, and (iii) single-layer NNs with a rectangular input set. For NNs with a single neuron, we propose a condition that ensures the SDP admits a rank-1 solution to DeepSDP by transforming the QCQP into an equivalent two-stage problem leads to a solution collinear with a predetermined vector. For single-layer NNs with an ellipsoidal input set, the collinearity of solutions is proved via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition in the two-stage problem. In case of single-layer NNs with a rectangular input set, we demonstrate that the tightness of DeepSDP can be reduced to the single-neuron NNs, case (i), if the weight matrix is a diagonal matrix."

In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \\textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency."

In this paper, we question whether this explicit thinking is necessary. Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use task-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, our research encourages a reconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also establishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance in low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling."

However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need to explore strategies to train effective reasoning LLMs with far fewer parameters. A critical challenge is that smaller models have different capacities and cognitive trajectories than their larger counterparts. Hence, direct distillation of chain-of-thought (CoT) results from large LLMs to smaller ones can be sometimes ineffective and requires a huge amount of annotated data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV), designed for training smaller yet powerful reasoning LLMs. Our CRV framework consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique abilities: (i) critiquing the CoTs according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. We further propose the cognitive preference optimization (CogPO) algorithm to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning thoughts of these models with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CRV and CogPO, which outperforms other training methods by a large margin."

We introduce \\emph{Backwards Adaptive Reward Shaping} (BARS), a no-regret framework that converts sparse outcomes-based rewards into effective procedure-based signals. BARS uses sparse rewards generated from terminal-state priors and cover trees to scale rewards while preventing exploitation. With Bellman contraction and $(\\Delta, \\epsilon)$-gap rewards, our backward Euler solver achieves $\\epsilon$-accuracy in $O\\left((R_{\\max}/\\Delta)\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$ iterations with $O(\\log T)$ dynamic regret over $T$ rounds. Our analysis, based on generic chaining, continuous scaling limits, and non-linear Feynman-Kac bounds, connects recent outcome-based methods' empirical successes with the benefits of intermediate supervision. Combined, this provides the first rigorous no-regret algorithm for outcome reward shaping, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success of DeepSeek's R1."

In this work, we introduce an adaptive multi-agent framework designed to enhance collaborative reasoning through both model-level training and system-level coordination. We construct M500, a high-quality dataset containing 500 multi-agent collaborative reasoning traces, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct on this dataset to produce M1-32B, a model optimized for multi-agent collaboration. To further enable adaptive reasoning, we propose a novel CEO agent that dynamically manages the discussion process, guiding agent collaboration and adjusting reasoning depth for more effective problem-solving. Evaluated in an open-source MAS across a range of tasks-including general understanding, mathematical reasoning, and coding-our system significantly outperforms strong baselines. For instance, M1-32B achieves 12% improvement on GPQA-Diamond, 41% on AIME2024, and 10% on MBPP-Sanitized, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 on some tasks.

However, a significant limitation of this framework is the introduction of asymptotically stable equilibrium points besides the minimizer of the CLF, leading to deadlock situations even for simple systems and bounded convex unsafe sets. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid CLF-CBF control framework with global asymptotic stabilization and safety guarantees, offering a more flexible and systematic design methodology compared to current alternatives available in the literature. We further extend this framework to higher-order systems via a recursive procedure based on a joint CLF-CBF backstepping approach. The proposed solution is assessed through several simulation examples."

However, existing methods iteratively refine boundary estimates by sampling in regions of uncertainty, without providing guarantees on the closeness to the decision boundary and also result in unnecessary exploration that is especially disadvantageous when evaluations are costly. This paper presents the Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE), a sample efficient and function-agnostic algorithm that leverages the intermediate value theorem to estimate the location of the decision boundary of a black box binary classifier within a user-specified epsilon-neighborhood. Evaluations are conducted on three nonlinear test functions and a case study of an electric grid stability problem with uncertain renewable power injection. The EDGE algorithm demonstrates superior sample efficiency and better boundary approximation than adaptive sampling techniques and grid-based searches."

Given this problem has not yet been tractable, we suggest targeting a key failure mechanism: the failure of safety to generalize across semantically equivalent inputs. We further focus the target by requiring desirable tractability properties of attacks to study: explainability, transferability between models, and transferability between goals. We perform red-teaming within this framework by uncovering new vulnerabilities to multi-turn, multi-image, and translation-based attacks. These attacks are semantically equivalent by our design to their single-turn, single-image, or untranslated counterparts, enabling systematic comparisons; we show that the different structures yield different safety outcomes. We then demonstrate the potential for this framework to enable new defenses by proposing a Structure Rewriting Guardrail, which converts an input to a structure more conducive to safety assessment. This guardrail significantly improves refusal of harmful inputs, without over-refusing benign ones. Thus, by framing this intermediate challenge - more tractable than universal defenses but essential for long-term safety - we highlight a critical milestone for AI safety research."

It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations.

With enough examples, the model's in-context learning abilities override its safety training, and it responds as if it were the ``fake'' assistant. In this work, we probe the effectiveness of different fine tuning and input sanitization approaches on mitigating MSJ attacks, alone and in combination. We find incremental mitigation effectiveness for each, and we show that the combined techniques significantly reduce the effectiveness of MSJ attacks, while retaining model performance in benign in-context learning and conversational tasks. We suggest that our approach could meaningfully ameliorate this vulnerability if incorporated into model safety post-training."

A multi-agent framework orchestrates the process, autonomously verifying inputs, generating configurations, running simulations, and correcting errors. Evaluation on a benchmark of 21 diverse flow cases demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.7% solution accuracy and 82.6% first-attempt success rate. This significantly outperforms larger general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while also requiring fewer correction iterations and maintaining high computational efficiency.

Methods A combination of theoretical calculations and actual measurements was used to compare and analyze the ambient equivalent dose rates of 192 Ir and 75 Se at their nominal source strengths. Measurements were conducted at distances of 1 m, 2 m, and 5 m from the radiation source. The extents of the control and supervision areas were estimated under three working scenarios: 1 without considering air attenuation, 2 considering air attenuation, and 3 after shielding by the flaw detection workpiece, using source activities of 3.7 * 10^10 Bq and 3.7 * 10^12Bq. Results Actual measurement of radiation dose of 192 Ir and 75 Se were measured under three different nominal activities. Theoretical calculation of radiation dose estimates at various distances were obtained for both nuclides, and the results showed that the theoretical values were basically consistent with the measured values. Conclusion The estimated scope of the supervision and control areas provided in this study can serve as a reference for flaw detection companies. Technicians can use these estimates to calculate appropriate distances for safety zones based on different nuclide activities. This enables flaw detection personnel to reduce the measurement scope on-site and to quickly and accurately define area boundaries."

    "summary": "Ensuring structural reliability remains a core concern in civil engineering, yet the quantitative effects of quality control measures on material variability and safety margins are not fully understood, especially for materials other than reinforced concrete. This study addresses this gap by presenting a probabilistic framework that integrates Bayesian updating, acceptance sampling, and operating characteristic (OC) curves to model conformity assessment as a probabilistic filter. In doing so, it refines prior distributions of key material and execution parameters based on quality control outcomes, linking reductions in the coefficient of variation directly to adjustments in partial safety factors. Applying the framework to a masonry wall example demonstrates how systematic quality control efforts, particularly those targeting parameters with higher importance such as masonry unit strength and execution quality-produce substantial gains in structural reliability. The analysis shows that combined quality control measures can lower the partial safety factor from a baseline of 1.5 to about 1.38, corresponding to an improvement factor of roughly 1.09 and material savings of approximately 8%. Conversely, controlling parameters with negligible influence, such as mortar properties, provides limited benefit. These findings encourage focusing quality control resources on the most influential parameters and integrating results into semi-probabilistic design methods. By offering a transparent, standards-compatible approach, the framework supports the refinement of design guidelines, promotes more efficient resource allocation, and enhances overall structural safety in the built environment."

Activation steering offers a training-free defense method but relies on fixed steering coefficients, resulting in suboptimal protection and increased false rejections of benign inputs. To address this, we propose AdaSteer, an adaptive activation steering method that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics. We identify two key properties: Rejection Law (R-Law), which shows that stronger steering is needed for jailbreak inputs opposing the rejection direction, and Harmfulness Law (H-Law), which differentiates adversarial and benign inputs. AdaSteer steers input representations along both the Rejection Direction (RD) and Harmfulness Direction (HD), with adaptive coefficients learned via logistic regression, ensuring robust jailbreak defense while preserving benign input handling. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5 show that AdaSteer outperforms baseline methods across multiple jailbreak attacks with minimal impact on utility. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable model internals for real-time, flexible safety enforcement in LLMs."

This motivates us to incorporate safety-policy-driven reasoning into the alignment process. To this end, we propose the Safety-oriented Reasoning Optimization Framework (SaRO), which consists of two stages: (1) Reasoning-style Warmup (RW) that enables LLMs to internalize long-chain reasoning through supervised fine-tuning, and (2) Safety-oriented Reasoning Process Optimization (SRPO) that promotes safety reflection via direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SaRO over traditional alignment methods."

By modeling the bias as a smooth signal over a graph constructed from geophysical or feature-based similarities, our convex formulation not only ensures a unique solution but also comes with theoretical recovery guarantees under certain assumptions. We validate GROUD on both challenging simulated experiments and real-world datasets -- including Atlanta emergency calls and COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports -- demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in accurately recovering debiased counts. This approach paves the way for more reliable downstream decision-making in systems affected by reporting irregularities."

The resulting ferroelectric domain patterns stem from the balance at the local scale of several effects playing a key role, i.e. piezoelectricity linked to strain, and flexoelectricity arising from strain gradients. To weight their respective contributions for a given membrane geometry, the strain profile has to be mapped with respect to the ferroelectric polarization landscape, a necessary step to allow for a controlled tailoring of the latter. In this study, we examine the effect of bending strain on a Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 membrane in a fold-like structure, observing a polarization rotation from out-of-plane to in-plane at the fold apex. Combining piezoresponse force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, we map the ferroelectric polarization direction relative to the height profile of the membrane, and discuss the contributions of strain and strain gradients for this archetypal fold geometry. Our findings offer new insights into strain-engineered polarization configurations, and emphasize strain effects at the nanoscale to tune the functional properties in freestanding membranes."

However, current methods struggle with challenges arising from multimodal data, such as dimensional disparities, mismatched target counts, vessel scale variations, occlusions, and asynchronous data streams from systems like the automatic identification system (AIS) and closed-circuit television (CCTV). Traditional multi-target association methods often struggle with these complexities, particularly in densely trafficked waterways. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph learning-driven multi-vessel association (GMvA) method tailored for maritime multimodal data fusion. By integrating AIS and CCTV data, GMvA leverages time series learning and graph neural networks to capture the spatiotemporal features of vessel trajectories effectively. To enhance feature representation, the proposed method incorporates temporal graph attention and spatiotemporal attention, effectively capturing both local and global vessel interactions. Furthermore, a multi-layer perceptron-based uncertainty fusion module computes robust similarity scores, and the Hungarian algorithm is adopted to ensure globally consistent and accurate target matching. Extensive experiments on real-world maritime datasets confirm that GMvA delivers superior accuracy and robustness in multi-target association, outperforming existing methods even in challenging scenarios with high vessel density and incomplete or unevenly distributed AIS and CCTV data."

Despite being fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, LLMs lack the capability to discern malicious content, limiting their defense against jailbreak. To address these safety concerns, we propose a feature-aware method for harmful response rejection (FMM), which detects the presence of malicious features within the model's feature space and adaptively adjusts the model's rejection mechanism. By employing a simple discriminator, we detect potential malicious traits during the decoding phase. Upon detecting features indicative of toxic tokens, FMM regenerates the current token. By employing activation patching, an additional rejection vector is incorporated during the subsequent token generation, steering the model towards a refusal response. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple language models and diverse attack techniques, while crucially maintaining the models' standard generation capabilities."

As one of the most promising materials for fabricating room - temperature nuclear radiation semiconductor detectors, HgI2 exhibits excellent detection performance due to its high atomic number, large band gap, strong ray - stopping power, and high volume dark resistivity. However, issues such as poor chemical stability and low vacancy mobility of HgI2 limit its development. Therefore, researchers have carried out inorganic doping/organic hybridization on it. By introducing the organic ligand CH3NH3I, the synthesis of organic - inorganic hybrid compounds based on HgI2 is expected to significantly improve the stability of HgI2. Research on organic - inorganic hybrid metal halide crystals shows that this material has great application potential in the field of luminescent materials."

Traditional wrists struggle to balance these demands, often relying on complex control schemes or complicated mechanical designs to mitigate potential damage from force overload. In response, we present BiFlex, a flexible robotic wrist that uses a soft buckling honeycomb structure to provides a natural bimodal stiffness response. The higher stiffness mode enables precise household object manipulation, while the lower stiffness mode provides the compliance needed to adapt to external forces. We design BiFlex to maintain a fingertip deflection of less than 1 cm while supporting loads up to 500g and create a BiFlex wrist for many grippers, including Panda, Robotiq, and BaRiFlex. We validate BiFlex under several real-world experimental evaluations, including surface wiping, precise pick-and-place, and grasping under environmental constraints. We demonstrate that BiFlex simplifies control while maintaining precise object manipulation and enhanced safety in real-world applications."

    "summary": "Effective leveraging of real-world driving datasets is crucial for enhancing the training of autonomous driving systems. While Offline Reinforcement Learning enables the training of autonomous vehicles using such data, most available datasets lack meaningful reward labels. Reward labeling is essential as it provides feedback for the learning algorithm to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviors, thereby improving policy performance. This paper presents a novel pipeline for generating human-aligned reward labels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of absent reward signals in real-world datasets by generating labels that reflect human judgment and safety considerations. The pipeline incorporates an adaptive safety component, activated by analyzing semantic segmentation maps, allowing the autonomous vehicle to prioritize safety over efficiency in potential collision scenarios. The proposed pipeline is applied to an occluded pedestrian crossing scenario with varying levels of pedestrian traffic, using synthetic and simulation data. The results indicate that the generated reward labels closely match the simulation reward labels. When used to train the driving policy using Behavior Proximal Policy Optimisation, the results are competitive with other baselines. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in producing reliable and human-aligned reward signals, facilitating the training of autonomous driving systems through Reinforcement Learning outside of simulation environments and in alignment with human values."

However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with unseen environments or dynamic constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose, Safe Flow Matching (SafeFM), a motion planning approach for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. By incorporating the proposed flow matching barrier functions, SafeFM ensures that generated trajectories remain within safe regions throughout the planning horizon, even in the presence of previously unseen obstacles or state-action constraints. Unlike diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for direct, efficient sampling of constraint-satisfying trajectories, making it well-suited for real-time motion planning. We evaluate SafeFM on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety, generalization, and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

This paper introduces TinyCenterSpeed, a streamlined adaptation of the seminal CenterPoint method, optimized for real-time performance on 1:10 scale autonomous racing platforms. This adaptation is viable even on OBCs powered solely by Central Processing Units (CPUs), as it incorporates the use of an external Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). We demonstrate that, compared to Adaptive Breakpoint Detector (ABD), the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) in scaled autonomous racing, TinyCenterSpeed not only improves detection and velocity estimation by up to 61.38% but also supports multi-opponent detection and estimation. It achieves real-time performance with an inference time of just 7.88 ms on the TPU, significantly reducing CPU utilization 8.3-fold."

As such, development of automated systems capable of detecting such events is of considerable importance in both academic and industrial contexts. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning for detecting thermal runaway in the battery production line of VDL Nedcar, a Dutch automobile manufacturer. Specifically, we collect data from the production line to represent both baseline (non thermal runaway) and thermal runaway conditions. Thermal runaway was simulated through the use of external heat and smoke sources. The data consisted of both optical and thermal images which were then preprocessed and fused before serving as input to our models. In this regard, we evaluated three deep-learning models widely used in computer vision including shallow convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and vision transformers on two performance metrics. Furthermore, we evaluated these models using explainability methods to gain insight into their ability to capture the relevant feature information from their inputs. The obtained results indicate that the use of deep learning is a viable approach to thermal runaway detection in battery production lines."

Modern approaches rely on penalty-based methods at training time, which do not guarantee to avoid constraints violations; or constraint-specific model architectures (e.g., for monotonocity); or on output projection, which requires to solve an optimization problem that might be computationally demanding. We present the Hypersherical Constrained Representation, a novel method to enforce constraints in the output space for convex and bounded feasibility regions (generalizable to star domains). Our method operates on a different representation system, where Euclidean coordinates are converted into hyperspherical coordinates relative to the constrained region, which can only inherently represent feasible points. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world dataset show that our method has predictive performance comparable to the other approaches, can guarantee 100% constraint satisfaction, and has a minimal computational cost at inference time."

    "summary": "Sorting is a tedious but simple task for human intelligence and can be solved fairly easily algorithmically. However, for Large Language Models (LLMs) this task is surprisingly hard, as some properties of sorting are among known weaknesses of LLMs: being faithful to the input data, logical comparisons between values, and strictly differentiating between syntax (used for sorting) and semantics (typically learned by embeddings). Within this paper, we describe the new SortBench benchmark for LLMs that comes with different difficulties and that can be easily scaled in terms of difficulty. We apply this benchmark to seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including current test-time reasoning models. Our results show that while the o3-mini model is very capable at sorting in general, even this can be fooled if strings are defined to mix syntactical and semantical aspects, e.g., by asking to sort numbers written-out as word. Furthermore, all models have problems with the faithfulness to the input of long lists, i.e., they drop items and add new ones. Our results also show that test-time reasoning has a tendency to overthink problems which leads to performance degradation. Finally, models without test-time reasoning like GPT-4o are not much worse than reasoning models."

This work compares survey data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) on healthcare decision-making with simulated responses from generative agents. Using demographic-based prompt engineering, we create digital twins of survey respondents and analyse how well different LLMs reproduce real-world behaviours. Our findings show that some LLMs fail to reflect realistic decision-making, such as predicting universal vaccine acceptance. However, Llama 3 captures variations across race and Income more accurately but also introduces biases not present in the UAS data. This study highlights the potential of generative agents for behavioural research while underscoring the risks of bias from both LLMs and prompting strategies."

While CBF-based controllers offer safety guarantees, they can compromise the performance of the system, leading to undesirable behaviors such as unbounded trajectories and emergence of locally stable spurious equilibria. Computing reachable sets for systems with CBF-based controllers is an effective approach for runtime performance and stability verification, and can potentially serve as a tool for trajectory re-planning. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient interval reachability method for performance verification of systems with optimization-based controllers by: (i) approximating the optimization-based controller by a pre-trained neural network to avoid solving optimization problems repeatedly, and (ii) using mixed monotone theory to construct an embedding system that leverages state-of-the-art neural network verification algorithms for bounding the output of the neural network. Results in terms of closeness of solutions of trajectories of the system with the optimization-based controller and the neural network are derived. Using a single trajectory of the embedding system along with our closeness of solutions result, we obtain an over-approximation of the reachable set of the system with optimization-based controllers. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the technical findings."

While vehicle sensing has been extensively studied, infrastructure sensing has received little attention, especially given the unique challenges of diverse intersection geometries, complex occlusions, varying traffic conditions, and ambient environments like lighting and weather. To address these issues and ensure cost-effective sensor placement, we propose Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement Evaluation (InSPE), a perception surrogate metric set that rapidly assesses perception effectiveness across diverse infrastructure and environmental scenarios with combinations of multi-modal sensors. InSPE systematically evaluates perception capabilities by integrating three carefully designed metrics, i.e., sensor coverage, perception occlusion, and information gain. To support large-scale evaluation, we develop a data generation tool within the CARLA simulator and also introduce Infra-Set, a dataset covering diverse intersection types and environmental conditions. Benchmarking experiments with state-of-the-art perception algorithms demonstrate that InSPE enables efficient and scalable sensor placement analysis, providing a robust solution for optimizing intelligent intersection infrastructure."

The FTA-BN integration combines the systematic decomposition of failure events provided by FTA with the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of BN, which allow for dynamic updates in failure probabilities, enhancing the adaptability of risk assessment. A fault tree is constructed based on AV subsystem architecture, with collision as the top event, and failure rates are assigned while ensuring the total remains within 100 FIT. Bayesian inference is applied to update posterior probabilities, and the results indicate that perception system failures (46.06 FIT) are the most significant contributor, particularly failures to detect existing objects (PF5) and misclassification (PF6). Mitigation strategies are proposed for sensors, perception, decision-making, and motion control to reduce the collision risk. The FTA-BN integration approach provides dynamic risk quantification, offering system designers refined failure rate targets to improve AV safety."

These images, though imperceptible to the human eye, significantly increase GPU energy consumption across various vision models, threatening the availability of these systems. Our framework, EO-VLM (Energy Overload via VLM), is model-agnostic, meaning it is not limited by the architecture or type of the target vision model. By exploiting the lack of safety filters in VLMs like DALL-E 3, we create adversarial noise images without requiring prior knowledge or internal structure of the target vision models. Our experiments demonstrate up to a 50% increase in energy consumption, revealing a critical vulnerability in current vision models."

However, prevailing gradient-based unlearning methods suffer from issues such as high computational costs, hyperparameter instability, poor sequential unlearning capability, vulnerability to relearning attacks, low data efficiency, and lack of interpretability. While Sparse Autoencoders are well-suited to improve these aspects by enabling targeted activation-based unlearning, prior approaches underperform gradient-based methods. This work demonstrates that, contrary to these earlier findings, SAEs can significantly improve unlearning when employed dynamically. We introduce $\\textbf{Dynamic DAE Guardrails}$ (DSG), a novel method for precision unlearning that leverages principled feature selection and a dynamic classifier. Our experiments show DSG substantially outperforms leading unlearning methods, achieving superior forget-utility trade-offs. DSG addresses key drawbacks of gradient-based approaches for unlearning -- offering enhanced computational efficiency and stability, robust performance in sequential unlearning, stronger resistance to relearning attacks, better data efficiency including zero-shot settings, and more interpretable unlearning."

    "summary": "In the realm of control systems, model predictive control (MPC) has exhibited remarkable potential; however, its reliance on accurate models and substantial computational resources has hindered its broader application, especially within real-time nonlinear systems. This study presents an innovative control framework to enhance the practical viability of the MPC. The developed safe data-driven predictive control aims to eliminate the requirement for precise models and alleviate computational burdens in the nonlinear MPC (NMPC). This is achieved by learning both the system dynamics and the control policy, enabling efficient data-driven predictive control while ensuring system safety. The methodology involves a spatial temporal filter (STF)-based concurrent learning for system identification, a robust control barrier function (RCBF) to ensure the system safety amid model uncertainties, and a RCBF-based NMPC policy approximation. An online policy correction mechanism is also introduced to counteract performance degradation caused by the existing model uncertainties. Demonstrated through simulations on two applications, the proposed approach offers comparable performance to existing benchmarks with significantly reduced computational costs."

    "summary": "Heavy-duty trucks pose significant safety challenges due to their large size and limited maneuverability compared to passenger vehicles. A deeper understanding of truck characteristics is essential for enhancing the safety perspective of cooperative autonomous driving. Traditional LiDAR-based truck classification methods rely on extensive manual annotations, which makes them labor-intensive and costly. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets presents an opportunity to leverage their few-shot learning capabilities for truck classification. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) are primarily trained on image datasets, which makes it challenging to directly process point cloud data. This study introduces a novel framework that integrates roadside LiDAR point cloud data with VLMs to facilitate efficient and accurate truck classification, which supports cooperative and safe driving environments. This study introduces three key innovations: (1) leveraging real-world LiDAR datasets for model development, (2) designing a preprocessing pipeline to adapt point cloud data for VLM input, including point cloud registration for dense 3D rendering and mathematical morphological techniques to enhance feature representation, and (3) utilizing in-context learning with few-shot prompting to enable vehicle classification with minimally labeled training data. Experimental results demonstrate encouraging performance of this method and present its potential to reduce annotation efforts while improving classification accuracy."

This example demonstrates the urgent need for focused, concise training on human-automation interaction - a need that is equally critical for operators of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles, as discussed in detail later in this article. The lack of structured education for semi-automated vehicle operators mirrors similar risks in other industries, where formal training is critical for safe operation. Two policy recommendations are proposed. First, governments should create concise, official resources in accessible and official format to educate drivers on system capabilities and limitations. Second, mandatory training and certification programs should be introduced, combining theoretical and hands-on components to prepare drivers for real-world scenarios. These measures will improve driver understanding, reduce misuse, and foster public trust in semi-automated vehicle technologies. By addressing the knowledge gap, policymakers can ensure a safer, more responsible transition to automation, maximizing its benefits while minimizing risks to public safety."

This study systematically compares reasoning-based LLMs (DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o3) with their non-reasoning counterparts across machine translation (MT) and text summarization (TS) evaluation tasks. We evaluate eight models across three architectural categories, including state-of-the-art reasoning models, their distilled variants (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters), and equivalent conventional, non-reasoning LLMs. Our experiments on WMT23 and SummEval benchmarks reveal that the benefits of reasoning capabilities are highly model and task-dependent: while OpenAI o3-mini models show consistent performance improvements with increased reasoning intensity, DeepSeek-R1 underperforms compared to its non-reasoning variant, with exception to certain aspects of TS evaluation. Correlation analysis demonstrates that increased reasoning token usage positively correlates with evaluation quality in o3-mini models. Furthermore, our results show that distillation of reasoning capabilities maintains reasonable performance in medium-sized models (32B) but degrades substantially in smaller variants (8B). This work provides the first comprehensive assessment of reasoning LLMs for NLG evaluation and offers insights into their practical use."

Despite achieving the promising attack success rate using dictionary-based evaluation, existing jailbreak attack methods fail to output detailed contents to satisfy the harmful request, leading to poor performance on GPT-based evaluation. To this end, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack termed GeneShift, by using a genetic algorithm to optimize the scenario shifts. Firstly, we observe that the malicious queries perform optimally under different scenario shifts. Based on it, we develop a genetic algorithm to evolve and select the hybrid of scenario shifts. It guides our method to elicit detailed and actionable harmful responses while keeping the seemingly benign facade, improving stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GeneShift. Notably, GeneShift increases the jailbreak success rate from 0% to 60% when direct prompting alone would fail."

Compared to its predecessor (v1, Lu et al., 2024 arXiv:2408.06292), The AI Scientist-v2 eliminates the reliance on human-authored code templates, generalizes effectively across diverse machine learning domains, and leverages a novel progressive agentic tree-search methodology managed by a dedicated experiment manager agent. Additionally, we enhance the AI reviewer component by integrating a Vision-Language Model (VLM) feedback loop for iterative refinement of content and aesthetics of the figures. We evaluated The AI Scientist-v2 by submitting three fully autonomous manuscripts to a peer-reviewed ICLR workshop. Notably, one manuscript achieved high enough scores to exceed the average human acceptance threshold, marking the first instance of a fully AI-generated paper successfully navigating a peer review. This accomplishment highlights the growing capability of AI in conducting all aspects of scientific research. We anticipate that further advancements in autonomous scientific discovery technologies will profoundly impact human knowledge generation, enabling unprecedented scalability in research productivity and significantly accelerating scientific breakthroughs, greatly benefiting society at large.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising improvements in accuracy and efficiency for this task. This study evaluates the performance and consistency of eight LLMs; four reasoning (Qwen QWQ, Deepseek Reasoner, GPT o3 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) and four non-reasoning (Llama 3.3, GPT 4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Deepseek Chat); in classifying clinical discharge summaries using the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using cTAKES to structure clinical narratives, models were assessed across three experimental runs, with majority voting determining final predictions. Results showed that reasoning models outperformed non-reasoning models in accuracy (71% vs 68%) and F1 score (67% vs 60%), with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking achieving the highest accuracy (75%) and F1 score (76%). However, non-reasoning models demonstrated greater stability (91% vs 84% consistency). Performance varied across ICD-10 codes, with reasoning models excelling in complex cases but struggling with abstract categories. Findings indicate a trade-off between accuracy and consistency, suggesting that a hybrid approach could optimise clinical coding. Future research should explore multi-label classification, domain-specific fine-tuning, and ensemble methods to enhance model reliability in real-world applications."

However, a rigorous evaluation framework for video CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately assess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies in perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos spanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034 high-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a stepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association with the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven distinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT process based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on VCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the top-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7% accuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score lower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in temporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust positive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity of our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning in solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a standardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex video reasoning task."

While promising, our initial experiments reveal that incorporating a thinking process through RL does not consistently lead to performance gains across all visual perception tasks. This leads us to delve into the essential role of RL in the context of visual perception. In this work, we return to the fundamentals and explore the effects of RL on different perception tasks. We observe that the perceptual complexity is a major factor in determining the effectiveness of RL. We also observe that reward design plays a crucial role in further approching the upper limit of model perception. To leverage these findings, we propose Perception-R1, a scalable RL framework using GRPO during MLLM post-training. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Perception-R1 achieves +4.2% on RefCOCO+, +17.9% on PixMo-Count, +4.2% on PageOCR, and notably, 31.9% AP on COCO2017 val for the first time, establishing a strong baseline for perception policy learning."

Our key insight is that the difficulty of training data during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is critical. Appropriately challenging samples can substantially boost reasoning capabilities even when the dataset is small. Despite being intuitive, the main challenge remains in accurately quantifying sample difficulty to enable effective data filtering. To this end, we propose a novel way of repurposing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve that. Starting from our curated 70k open-source training samples, we introduce an MCTS-based selection method that quantifies sample difficulty based on the number of iterations required by the VLMs to solve each problem. This explicit step-by-step reasoning in MCTS enforces the model to think longer and better identifies samples that are genuinely challenging. We filter and retain 11k samples to perform RFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, resulting in our final model, ThinkLite-VL. Evaluation results on eight benchmarks show that ThinkLite-VL improves the average performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 7%, using only 11k training samples with no knowledge distillation. This significantly outperforms all existing 7B-level reasoning VLMs, and our fairly comparable baselines that use classic selection methods such as accuracy-based filtering. Notably, on MathVista, ThinkLite-VL-7B achieves the SoTA accuracy of 75.1, surpassing Qwen2.5-VL-72B, GPT-4o, and O1.

However, their increasing integration into critical societal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and compromise fairness. These biases stem from various sources, including historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, and adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased responses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM robustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i) systematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases across various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of model responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in both small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety. Additionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for critical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability benchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and safety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language models."

    "summary": "We present Pangu Ultra, a Large Language Model (LLM) with 135 billion parameters and dense Transformer modules trained on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs). Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented advances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training such a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system challenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich normalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training process of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during post-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize 8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on multiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances the state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral Large 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse model structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates that Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense models with more than 100 billion parameters. Our model and system will be available for our commercial customers."

    "summary": "Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches."

Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as our experimental framework, we show that language models (Llama, DeepSeek R1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) can generate deceptive explanations that evade detection. Our agents employ steganographic methods to hide information in seemingly innocent explanations, successfully fooling oversight models while achieving explanation quality comparable to reference labels. We further find that models can scheme to develop deceptive strategies when they believe the detection of harmful features might lead to negative consequences for themselves. All tested LLM agents were capable of deceiving the overseer while achieving high interpretability scores comparable to those of reference labels. We conclude by proposing mitigation strategies, emphasizing the critical need for robust understanding and defenses against deception."

Likelihood-based deep generative models have historically faced criticism for their unsatisfactory performance in OOD detection, often assigning higher likelihood to OOD data than in-distribution samples when applied to image data. In this work, we demonstrate that likelihood is not inherently flawed. Rather, several properties in the images space prohibit likelihood as a valid detection score. Given a sufficiently good likelihood estimator, specifically using the probability flow formulation of a diffusion model, we show that likelihood-based methods can still perform on par with state-of-the-art methods when applied in the representation space of pre-trained encoders.

    "summary": "In this paper, we ask the question of why the quality of commercial software, in terms of security and safety, does not measure up to that of other (durable) consumer goods we have come to expect. We examine this question through the lens of incentives. We argue that the challenge around better quality software is due in no small part to a sequence of misaligned incentives, the most critical of which being that the harm caused by software problems is by and large shouldered by consumers, not developers. This lack of liability means software vendors have every incentive to rush low-quality software onto the market and no incentive to enhance quality control. Within this context, this paper outlines a holistic technical and policy framework we believe is needed to incentivize better and more secure software development. At the heart of the incentive realignment is the concept of software liability. This framework touches on various components, including legal, technical, and financial, that are needed for software liability to work in practice; some currently exist, some will need to be re-imagined or established. This is primarily a market-driven approach that emphasizes voluntary participation but highlights the role appropriate regulation can play. We connect and contrast this with the EU legal environment and discuss what this framework means for open-source software (OSS) development and emerging AI risks. Moreover, we present a CrowdStrike case study complete with a what-if analysis had our proposed framework been in effect. Our intention is very much to stimulate a robust conversation among both researchers and practitioners."

The proposed strategy enables VPPs, acting as aggregators for inverter-based resources (IBRs), to provide optimal frequency support economically. The proposed strategy captures time-varying active power injections, reducing the unnecessary redundancy compared to traditional fixed reserve schemes. Reserve requirements for the VPPs are determined based on system frequency response and safety constraints, ensuring efficient grid support. Furthermore, an energy-based allocation model decomposes power injections for each IBR, accounting for their specific limitations. Numerical experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting significant financial gains for VPPs, especially as system inertia decreases due to higher renewable energy integration."

Sophisticated automated driving assistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in platooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and decentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies. This study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed at promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation strategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional phase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving. Additionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics related to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering regulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of these cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to individual route planning for long road trips."

In recent years, the end-to-end driving has shown great promise in advancing vehicle autonomy in a scalable manner. However, existing approaches often face safety risks due to the lack of explicit behavior constraints. To address this issue, we uncover a new paradigm by introducing the corridor as the intermediate representation. Widely adopted in robotics planning, the corridors represents spatio-temporal obstacle-free zones for the vehicle to traverse. To ensure accurate corridor prediction in diverse traffic scenarios, we develop a comprehensive learning pipeline including data annotation, architecture refinement and loss formulation. The predicted corridor is further integrated as the constraint in a trajectory optimization process. By extending the differentiability of the optimization, we enable the optimized trajectory to be seamlessly trained within the end-to-end learning framework, improving both safety and interpretability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach, showing a 66.7% reduction in collisions with agents and a 46.5% reduction with curbs, significantly enhancing the safety of end-to-end driving. Additionally, incorporating the corridor contributes to higher success rates in closed-loop evaluations."

However, this introduces new vulnerabilities, known as prompt injection attacks, where external content embeds malicious instructions that manipulate the LLM's output. Recently, the Base64 defense has been recognized as one of the most effective methods for reducing success rate of prompt injection attacks. Despite its efficacy, this method can degrade LLM performance on certain NLP tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense mechanism: mixture of encodings, which utilizes multiple character encodings, including Base64. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves one of the lowest attack success rates under prompt injection attacks, while maintaining high performance across all NLP tasks, outperforming existing character encoding-based defense methods. This underscores the effectiveness of our mixture of encodings strategy for both safety and task performance metrics."

    "summary": "Fruit drying is widely used in food manufacturing to reduce product moisture, ensure product safety, and extend product shelf life. Accurately predicting final moisture content (MC) is critically needed for quality control of drying processes. State-of-the-art methods can build deterministic relationships between process parameters and MC, but cannot adequately account for inherent process variabilities that are ubiquitous in fruit drying. To address this gap, this paper presents a novel multi-modal data fusion framework to effectively fuse two modalities of data: tabular data (process parameters) and high-dimensional image data (images of dried apple slices) to enable accurate MC prediction. The proposed modeling architecture permits flexible adjustment of information portion from tabular and image data modalities. Experimental validation shows that the multi-modal approach improves predictive accuracy substantially compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method reduces root-mean-squared errors by 19.3%, 24.2%, and 15.2% over tabular-only, image-only, and standard tabular-image fusion models, respectively. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that our method is robust in varied tabular-image ratios and capable of effectively capturing inherent small-scale process variabilities. The proposed framework is extensible to a variety of other drying technologies."

We propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI), a simple yet effective approach that freezes the projection matrices $A$ as random projections and sparsifies the matrices $B$ using task-specific masks. This design substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong task performance. Moreover, LoRI minimizes cross-task interference in adapter merging by leveraging the orthogonality between adapter subspaces, and supports continual learning by using sparsity to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks demonstrate that LoRI outperforms full fine-tuning and existing PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference. Code is available at: https://github.com/juzhengz/LoRI"

In this work, we aim to systematically study this open question, using the structured task of event extraction for a case study.

However, their widespread adoption remains limited by high computational costs, significant energy demands, and security risks such as data leakage and adversarial attacks. As a lighter-weight alternative, Small Language Models (SLMs) offer faster inference, lower deployment overhead, and better adaptability to domain-specific tasks, making them an attractive option for real-world applications. While prior research has benchmarked LLMs on competitive programming tasks, such evaluations often focus narrowly on metrics like Elo scores or pass rates, overlooking deeper insights into model behavior, failure patterns, and problem diversity. Furthermore, the potential of SLMs to tackle complex tasks such as competitive programming remains underexplored. In this study, we benchmark five open SLMs - LLAMA 3.2 3B, GEMMA 2 9B, GEMMA 3 12B, DEEPSEEK-R1 14B, and PHI-4 14B - across 280 Codeforces problems spanning Elo ratings from 800 to 2100 and covering 36 distinct topics. All models were tasked with generating Python solutions. PHI-4 14B achieved the best performance among SLMs, with a pass@3 of 63.6%, approaching the proprietary O3-MINI-HIGH (86.8%). In addition, we evaluated PHI-4 14B on C++ and found that combining outputs from both Python and C++ increases its aggregated pass@3 to 73.6%. A qualitative analysis of PHI-4 14B's incorrect outputs revealed that some failures were due to minor implementation issues - such as handling edge cases or correcting variable initialization - rather than deeper reasoning flaws."

All models detected nearly all test smell instances (pass@5 of 96% with four agents), with PHI 4 14B achieving the highest refactoring accuracy (pass@5 of 75.3%). Analyses were computationally inexpensive and ran efficiently on a consumer-grade hardware. Notably, PHI 4 14B with four agents performed within 5% of proprietary models such as O1-MINI, O3-MINI-HIGH, and GEMINI 2.5 PRO EXPERIMENTAL using a single agent. Multi-agent setups outperformed single-agent ones in three out of five test smell types, highlighting their potential to improve software quality with minimal developer effort. For the Assertion Roulette smell, however, a single agent performed better. To assess practical relevance, we submitted 10 pull requests with PHI 4 14B - generated code to open-source projects. Five were merged, one was rejected, and four remain under review, demonstrating the approach's real-world applicability."

    "summary": "Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) is prone to catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks significantly degrades performance on previously learned ones. Existing methods typically rely on low-rank, parameter-efficient updates that limit the model's expressivity and introduce additional parameters per task, leading to scalability issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel continual full fine-tuning approach leveraging adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). Our method dynamically identifies task-specific low-rank parameter subspaces and constrains updates to be orthogonal to critical directions associated with prior tasks, thus effectively minimizing interference without additional parameter overhead or storing previous task gradients. We evaluate our approach extensively on standard continual learning benchmarks using both encoder-decoder (T5-Large) and decoder-only (LLaMA-2 7B) models, spanning diverse tasks including classification, generation, and reasoning. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, up to 7% higher average accuracy than recent baselines like O-LoRA, and notably maintains the model's general linguistic capabilities, instruction-following accuracy, and safety throughout the continual learning process by reducing forgetting to near-negligible levels. Our adaptive SVD framework effectively balances model plasticity and knowledge retention, providing a practical, theoretically grounded, and computationally scalable solution for continual learning scenarios in large language models."

Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities."

We introduce AgentGym, the largest procedurally-curated executable gym environment for training real-world SWE-agents, consisting of more than 8.7K tasks. AgentGym is powered by two main contributions: 1) SYNGEN: a synthetic data curation recipe that enables scalable curation of executable environments using test-generation and back-translation directly from commits, thereby reducing reliance on human-written issues or unit tests. We show that this enables more scalable training leading to pass@1 performance of 34.4% on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark with our 32B model. 2) Hybrid Test-time Scaling: we provide an in-depth analysis of two test-time scaling axes; execution-based and execution-free verifiers, demonstrating that they exhibit complementary strengths and limitations. Test-based verifiers suffer from low distinguishability, while execution-free verifiers are biased and often rely on stylistic features. Surprisingly, we find that while each approach individually saturates around 42-43%, significantly higher gains can be obtained by leveraging their complementary strengths. Overall, our approach achieves 51% on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE-agents and for the first time showing competitive performance with proprietary models such as o1, o1-preview and sonnet-3.5-v2 (with tools). We will open-source our environments, models, and agent trajectories."

    "summary": "While test-time reasoning enables language models to tackle complex tasks, searching or planning in natural language can be slow, costly, and error-prone. But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for \"self-steering\" LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. In decoupling planning from execution, our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs."

Working within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in such multifractal spacetime. Our analysis reveals that a non-differentiable nature of spacetime is not merely compatible with quantum field theory but significantly enhances its mathematical foundation. Most notably, this approach guarantees the finiteness of the theory at all orders in perturbation theory and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture. The multifractal structure tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety, substantially improving the theory's behavior in the deep ultraviolet regime. Our formulation preserves all established predictions of standard quantum field theory at low energies while offering novel physical behaviors at high energy scales."

However, the memory overhead of storing all experts remains a major limitation, especially in large-scale MoE models such as DeepSeek-R1 (671B). In this study, we investigate domain specialization and expert redundancy in large-scale MoE models and uncover a consistent behavior we term few-shot expert localization, with only a few demonstrations, the model consistently activates a sparse and stable subset of experts. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective pruning framework, EASY-EP, that leverages a few domain-specific demonstrations to identify and retain only the most relevant experts. EASY-EP comprises two key components: output-aware expert importance assessment and expert-level token contribution estimation. The former evaluates the importance of each expert for the current token by considering the gating scores and magnitudes of the outputs of activated experts, while the latter assesses the contribution of tokens based on representation similarities after and before routed experts. Experiments show that our method can achieve comparable performances and $2.99\\times$ throughput under the same memory budget with full DeepSeek-R1 with only half the experts.

This has led to an expanding field of research in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), highlighting the potential of explanations to enhance trust, support adoption, and meet regulatory standards. However, the question of what constitutes a \"good\" explanation is dependent on the goals, stakeholders, and context. At a high level, psychological insights such as the concept of mental model alignment can offer guidance, but success in practice is challenging due to social and technical factors. As a result of this ill-defined nature of the problem, explanations can be of poor quality (e.g. unfaithful, irrelevant, or incoherent), potentially leading to substantial risks. Instead of fostering trust and safety, poorly designed explanations can actually cause harm, including wrong decisions, privacy violations, manipulation, and even reduced AI adoption. Therefore, we caution stakeholders to beware of explanations of AI: while they can be vital, they are not automatically a remedy for transparency or responsible AI adoption, and their misuse or limitations can exacerbate harm. Attention to these caveats can help guide future research to improve the quality and impact of AI explanations."

While conventional manual inspections suffer from subjectivity, existing machine learning-based methods are constrained by their reliance on large and high-quality labeled datasets, which require significant resources and limit adaptability across varied road conditions. The revolutionary advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant potential for overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose an innovative automated zero-shot learning approach that leverages the image recognition and natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to assess road conditions effectively. Multiple LLM-based assessment models were developed, employing prompt engineering strategies aligned with the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) standards. These models' accuracy and reliability were evaluated against official PSCI results, with an optimized model ultimately selected. Extensive tests benchmarked the optimized model against evaluations from various levels experts using Google Street View road images. The results reveal that the LLM-based approach can effectively assess road conditions, with the optimized model -employing comprehensive and structured prompt engineering strategies -outperforming simpler configurations by achieving high accuracy and consistency, even surpassing expert evaluations. Moreover, successfully applying the optimized model to Google Street View images demonstrates its potential for future city-scale deployments. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating road damage evaluations and underscore the pivotal role of detailed prompt engineering in achieving reliable assessments."

These frameworks struggle to quantify dynamic interaction risks in real-time and depend heavily on manual rules, resulting in low computational efficiency and conservative strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Residual Safe Reinforcement Learning (DRS-RL) framework grounded in a safety-enhanced networked Markov decision process. It's the first time that the weak-to-strong theory is introduced into multi-agent decision-making, enabling lightweight dynamic calibration of safety boundaries via a weak-to-strong safety correction paradigm. Based on the multi-agent dynamic conflict zone model, our framework accurately captures spatiotemporal coupling risks among heterogeneous traffic participants and surpasses the static constraints of conventional geometric rules. Moreover, a risk-aware prioritized experience replay mechanism mitigates data distribution bias by mapping risk to sampling probability. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in safety, efficiency, and comfort. Specifically, it reduces the collision rate by up to 92.17%, while the safety model accounts for merely 27% of the main model's parameters."

On one hand, these systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent.   This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring effective personalization and responsible deployment."

Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method across different LLMs. We also show that both removing and adding more humor to our method can reduce its effectiveness -- excessive humor possibly distracts the LLM from fulfilling its unsafe request. Thus, we argue that LLM jailbreaking occurs when there is a proper balance between focus on the unsafe request and presence of humor."

    "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning by leveraging increased test-time computation and exhibiting behaviors akin to human-like deliberation. Despite these advances, it remains an open question whether LRMs are better calibrated - particularly in their verbalized confidence - compared to instruction-tuned counterparts. In this paper, we investigate the calibration properties of LRMs trained via supervised fine-tuning distillation on long reasoning traces (henceforth SFT reasoning models) and outcome-based reinforcement learning for reasoning (henceforth RL reasoning models) across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that LRMs significantly outperform instruction-tuned models on complex reasoning tasks in both accuracy and confidence calibration. In contrast, we find surprising trends in the domain of factuality in particular. On factuality tasks, while Deepseek-R1 shows strong calibration behavior, smaller QwQ-32B shows no improvement over instruct models; moreover, SFT reasoning models display worse calibration (greater overconfidence) compared to instruct models. Our results provide evidence for a potentially critical role of reasoning-oriented RL training in improving LLMs' capacity for generating trustworthy, self-aware outputs."

    "summary": "Reachability analysis is an important method in providing safety guarantees for systems with unknown or uncertain dynamics. Due to the computational intractability of exact reachability analysis for general nonlinear, high-dimensional systems, recent work has focused on the use of probabilistic methods for computing approximate reachable sets. In this work, we advocate for the use of a general purpose, practical, and sharp method for data-driven reachability: the holdout method. Despite the simplicity of the holdout method, we show -- on several numerical examples including scenario-based reach tubes -- that the resulting probabilistic bounds are substantially sharper and require fewer samples than existing methods for data-driven reachability. Furthermore, we complement our work with a discussion on the necessity of probabilistic reachability bounds. We argue that any method that attempts to de-randomize the bounds, by converting the guarantees to hold deterministically, requires (a) an exponential in state-dimension amount of samples to achieve non-vacuous guarantees, and (b) extra assumptions on the dynamics."

    "summary": "Recording the open surgery process is essential for educational and medical evaluation purposes; however, traditional single-camera methods often face challenges such as occlusions caused by the surgeon's head and body, as well as limitations due to fixed camera angles, which reduce comprehensibility of the video content. This study addresses these limitations by employing a multi-viewpoint camera recording system, capturing the surgical procedure from six different angles to mitigate occlusions. We propose a fully supervised learning-based time series prediction method to choose the best shot sequences from multiple simultaneously recorded video streams, ensuring optimal viewpoints at each moment. Our time series prediction model forecasts future camera selections by extracting and fusing visual and semantic features from surgical videos using pre-trained models. These features are processed by a temporal prediction network with TimeBlocks to capture sequential dependencies. A linear embedding layer reduces dimensionality, and a Softmax classifier selects the optimal camera view based on the highest probability. In our experiments, we created five groups of open thyroidectomy videos, each with simultaneous recordings from six different angles. The results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy compared to traditional supervised methods, even when predicting over longer time horizons. Furthermore, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art time series prediction techniques on our dataset. This manuscript makes a unique contribution by presenting an innovative framework that advances surgical video analysis techniques, with significant implications for improving surgical education and patient safety."

In this work, we propose a risk-adaptive approach based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk Barrier Function (CVaR-BF), where the risk level is automatically adjusted to accept the minimum necessary risk, achieving a good performance in terms of safety and optimization feasibility under uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic zone-based barrier function which characterizes the collision likelihood by evaluating the relative state between the robot and the obstacle. By integrating risk adaptation with this new function, our approach adaptively expands the safety margin, enabling the robot to proactively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic environments. Comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing social navigation approaches, and validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework."

However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub \"counterfactual instruction following\". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research."

Our approach extends a sampling-based planner to solve CL-MRMP while preserving probabilistic completeness. To improve efficiency, we introduce novel biasing techniques. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating motion plans, with significant performance gains from biasing strategies."

It focuses on improving safety, reliability, and efficiency by automating valve control and integrating IoT-based monitoring. Automated shut-off valves are designed to detect sudden pressure drops and block leaks instantly. These valves utilize pressure drop rates and valve position sensors to detect and isolate leaks. Wireless pressure sensors and real-time monitoring systems enable remote control of gas flow. Mathematical modeling is employed to analyze pressure variations along damaged sections in order to determine optimal valve placement and activation timing. Machine learning algorithms in the control center are used to predict and verify leak locations based on sensor data. To ensure uninterrupted gas supply in the event of an accident, the study develops an empirical formula for determining the location of connecting pipes activated between parallel pipelines, based on real-time pressure data. The aim of this research is to reduce gas leaks and environmental hazards, ensure continuous gas supply during emergencies, enhance decision-making through automated systems, minimize gas losses, and reduce maintenance costs."

    "summary": "To apply reinforcement learning to safety-critical applications, we ought to provide safety guarantees during both policy training and deployment. In this work we present novel theoretical results that provide a bound on the probability of violating a safety property for a new task-specific policy in a model-free, episodic setup: the bound, based on a `maximum policy ratio' that is computed with respect to a `safe' base policy, can also be more generally applied to temporally-extended properties (beyond safety) and to robust control problems. We thus present SPoRt, which also provides a data-driven approach for obtaining such a bound for the base policy, based on scenario theory, and which includes Projected PPO, a new projection-based approach for training the task-specific policy while maintaining a user-specified bound on property violation. Hence, SPoRt enables the user to trade off safety guarantees in exchange for task-specific performance. Accordingly, we present experimental results demonstrating this trade-off, as well as a comparison of the theoretical bound to posterior bounds based on empirical violation rates."

    "summary": "In robotics, control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filters are commonly used to enforce state constraints. A critical challenge arises when the relative degree of the CBF varies across the state space. This variability can create regions within the safe set where the control input becomes unconstrained. When implemented as a safety filter, this may result in chattering near the safety boundary and ultimately compromise system safety. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for CBF synthesis by formulating it as solving a set of boundary value problems. The solutions to the boundary value problems are determined using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our approach ensures that the synthesized CBFs maintain a constant relative degree across the set of admissible states, thereby preventing unconstrained control scenarios. We illustrate the approach in simulation and further verify it through real-world quadrotor experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving desired system safety properties."

    "summary": "Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high)."

    "summary": "Safety is critical during human-robot interaction. But -- because people are inherently unpredictable -- it is often difficult for robots to plan safe behaviors. Instead of relying on our ability to anticipate humans, here we identify robot policies that are robust to unexpected human decisions. We achieve this by formulating human-robot interaction as a zero-sum game, where (in the worst case) the human's actions directly conflict with the robot's objective. Solving for the Nash Equilibrium of this game provides robot policies that maximize safety and performance across a wide range of human actions. Existing approaches attempt to find these optimal policies by leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi analysis (which is intractable) or linear-quadratic approximations (which are inexact). By contrast, in this work we propose a computationally efficient and theoretically justified method that converges towards the Nash Equilibrium policy. Our approach (which we call MCLQ) leverages linear-quadratic games to obtain an initial guess at safe robot behavior, and then iteratively refines that guess with a Monte Carlo search. Not only does MCLQ provide real-time safety adjustments, but it also enables the designer to tune how conservative the robot is -- preventing the system from focusing on unrealistic human behaviors. Our simulations and user study suggest that this approach advances safety in terms of both computation time and expected performance.

The number of measurable states and their precision offered by the onboard vehicle sensor system are often constrained by cost. For instance, measuring critical quantities such as the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) poses significant commercial challenges using current optical sensors. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance virtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety. The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a machine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from onboard sensor data. A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on uncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion. These mechanisms enable the dynamic weighting of uncertainty-aware predictions from machine learning and vehicle motion models to produce accurate and reliable hybrid VSA estimates. This work also presents a novel dataset named Real-world Vehicle State Estimation Dataset (ReV-StED), comprising synchronized measurements from advanced vehicle dynamic sensors. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method for VSA estimation, highlighting UAHL as a promising architecture for advancing virtual sensors and enhancing active safety in autonomous vehicles."
