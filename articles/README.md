| 2025-02-21 | [Discrete implementations of sliding-mode controllers with barrier-function adaptations require a revised framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15201v1) | Luis Ovalle, AndrÃ©s GonzÃ¡lez et al. | Challenges in the discrete implementation of sliding-mode controllers (SMC) with barrier-function-based adaptations are analyzed, revealing fundamental limitations in conventional design frameworks. It is shown that under uniform sampling, the original continuous-time problem motivating these controllers becomes theoretically unsolvable under standard assumptions. To address this incompatibility, a revised control framework is proposed, explicitly incorporating actuator capacity constraints and sampled-data dynamics. Within this structure, the behavior of barrier function-based adaptive controllers (BFASMC) is rigorously examined, explaining their empirical success in digital implementations. A key theoretical result establishes an explicit relation between the actuator capacity, the sampling rate, and the width of the barrier function, providing a principled means to tune these controllers for different application requirements. This relation enables the resolution of various design problems with direct practical implications. A modified BFASMC is then introduced, systematically leveraging sampling effects to ensure finite-time convergence to a positively invariant predefined set, a key advancement for guaranteeing predictable safety margins. |

Recent advancements in occupancy forecasting have enabled forecasting future 3D occupied status in driving environments by observing historical 2D images. However, high computational demands make occupancy forecasting less efficient during training and inference stages, hindering its feasibility for deployment on edge agents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, i.e., OccProphet, to efficiently and effectively learn occupancy forecasting with significantly lower computational requirements while improving forecasting accuracy. OccProphet comprises three lightweight components: Observer, Forecaster, and Refiner. The Observer extracts spatio-temporal features from 3D multi-frame voxels using the proposed Efficient 4D Aggregation with Tripling-Attention Fusion, while the Forecaster and Refiner conditionally predict and refine future occupancy inferences. Experimental results on nuScenes, Lyft-Level5, and nuScenes-Occupancy datasets demonstrate that OccProphet is both training- and inference-friendly. OccProphet reduces 58\%$\sim$78\% of the computational cost with a 2.6$\times$ speedup compared with the state-of-the-art Cam4DOcc. Moreover, it achieves 4\%$\sim$18\% relatively higher forecasting accuracy. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JLChen-C/OccProphet. |

While existing research has explored generating safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing, there is limited work on effectively incorporating these scenarios into policy learning to enhance safety. Furthermore, developing training curricula that adapt to an AV's evolving behavioral patterns and performance bottlenecks remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose CurricuVLM, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable personalized curriculum learning for autonomous driving agents. Our approach uniquely exploits VLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities to analyze agent behavior, identify performance weaknesses, and dynamically generate tailored training scenarios for curriculum adaptation. Through comprehensive analysis of unsafe driving situations with narrative descriptions, CurricuVLM performs in-depth reasoning to evaluate the AV's capabilities and identify critical behavioral patterns. The framework then synthesizes customized training scenarios targeting these identified limitations, enabling effective and personalized curriculum learning. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset show that CurricuVLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across both regular and safety-critical scenarios, achieving superior performance in terms of navigation success, driving efficiency, and safety metrics. Further analysis reveals that CurricuVLM serves as a general approach that can be integrated with various RL algorithms to enhance autonomous driving systems. The code and demo video are available at: https://zihaosheng.github.io/CurricuVLM/. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Is Safety Standard Same for Everyone? User-Specific Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15086v1) | Yeonjun In, Wonjoong Kim et al. | As the use of large language model (LLM) agents continues to grow, their safety vulnerabilities have become increasingly evident. Extensive benchmarks evaluate various aspects of LLM safety by defining the safety relying heavily on general standards, overlooking user-specific standards. However, safety standards for LLM may vary based on a user-specific profiles rather than being universally consistent across all users. This raises a critical research question: Do LLM agents act safely when considering user-specific safety standards? Despite its importance for safe LLM use, no benchmark datasets currently exist to evaluate the user-specific safety of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce U-SAFEBENCH, the first benchmark designed to assess user-specific aspect of LLM safety. Our evaluation of 18 widely used LLMs reveals current LLMs fail to act safely when considering user-specific safety standards, marking a new discovery in this field. To address this vulnerability, we propose a simple remedy based on chain-of-thought, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user-specific safety. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/yeonjun-in/U-SafeBench. |
| 2025-02-20 | [InterFeedback: Unveiling Interactive Intelligence of Large Multimodal Models via Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15027v1) | Henry Hengyuan Zhao, Wenqi Pei et al. | Existing benchmarks do not test Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on their interactive intelligence with human users which is vital for developing general-purpose AI assistants. We design InterFeedback, an interactive framework, which can be applied to any LMM and dataset to assess this ability autonomously. On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Our evaluation results show that even state-of-the-art LMM (like OpenAI-o1) can correct their results through human feedback less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance the LMMs' capability to interpret and benefit from feedback. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15026v1) | Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao et al. | This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety and feasibility in control systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Existing CBF-based Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) often encounter feasibility issues due to mixed relative degree constraints, input nullification problems, and the presence of tight or time-varying control bounds, which can lead to infeasible solutions and compromised safety. To address these challenges, we propose Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions (AVCBFs), a novel framework that introduces auxiliary functions to dynamically adjust CBF constraints without the need of excessive additional constraints. The AVCBF method ensures that all components of the control input explicitly appear in the desired-order safety constraint, thereby improving feasibility while maintaining safety guarantees. Additionally, we introduce an automatic tuning method that iteratively adjusts AVCBF hyperparameters to ensure feasibility and safety with less conservatism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adaptive cruise control and obstacle avoidance scenarios, showing that AVCBFs outperform existing CBF methods by reducing infeasibility and enhancing adaptive safety control under tight or time-varying control bounds. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Safe Beyond the Horizon: Efficient Sampling-based MPC with Neural Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15006v1) | Ji Yin, Oswin So et al. | A common problem when using model predictive control (MPC) in practice is the satisfaction of safety specifications beyond the prediction horizon. While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to ''black-box'' dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Probabilistic Robustness in Deep Learning: A Concise yet Comprehensive Guide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14833v1) | Xingyu Zhao | Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated significant potential across various safety-critical applications, yet ensuring its robustness remains a key challenge. While adversarial robustness has been extensively studied in worst-case scenarios, probabilistic robustness (PR) offers a more practical perspective by quantifying the likelihood of failures under stochastic perturbations. This paper provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of PR, covering its formal definitions, evaluation and enhancement methods. We introduce a reformulated ''min-max'' optimisation framework for adversarial training specifically designed to improve PR. Furthermore, we explore the integration of PR verification evidence into system-level safety assurance, addressing challenges in translating DL model-level robustness to system-level claims. Finally, we highlight open research questions, including benchmarking PR evaluation methods, extending PR to generative AI tasks, and developing rigorous methodologies and case studies for system-level integration. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Logic-RL: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14768v1) | Tian Xie, Zitian Gao et al. | Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1, we explore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) in large reasoning models. To analyze reasoning dynamics, we use synthetic logic puzzles as training data due to their controllable complexity and straightforward answer verification. We make some key technical contributions that lead to effective and stable RL training: a system prompt that emphasizes the thinking and answering process, a stringent format reward function that penalizes outputs for taking shortcuts, and a straightforward training recipe that achieves stable convergence. Our 7B model develops advanced reasoning skills-such as reflection, verification, and summarization-that are absent from the logic corpus. Remarkably, after training on just 5K logic problems, it demonstrates generalization abilities to the challenging math benchmarks AIME and AMC. |
| 2025-02-20 | [HiddenDetect: Detecting Jailbreak Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models via Monitoring Hidden States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14744v1) | Yilei Jiang, Xinyan Gao et al. | The integration of additional modalities increases the susceptibility of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to safety risks, such as jailbreak attacks, compared to their language-only counterparts. While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/leigest519/HiddenDetect. |

| 2025-02-20 | [SuperGPQA: Scaling LLM Evaluation across 285 Graduate Disciplines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14739v1) | M-A-P Team, Xinrun Du et al. | Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture, and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope. |
| 2025-02-20 | [PEARL: Towards Permutation-Resilient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14628v1) | Liang Chen, Li Shen et al. | The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations. However, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to instability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be exploited to design a natural attack - difficult for model providers to detect - that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the demonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing and fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations, raising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance against the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a permutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most challenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which is solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax optimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other, progressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic pre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL effectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably, despite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves performance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context scenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities. |
| 2025-02-20 | [A Stackelberg Game Approach for Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis with Uncontrollable Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14585v1) | Bohan Cui, Xinyi Yu et al. | In this paper, we investigate the control synthesis problem for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in the presence of uncontrollable agents. Existing works mainly address this problem in a robust control setting by assuming the uncontrollable agents are adversarial and accounting for the worst-case scenario. While this approach ensures safety, it can be overly conservative in scenarios where uncontrollable agents have their own objectives that are not entirely opposed to the system's goals. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a new framework for STL control synthesis within the Stackelberg game setting. Specifically, we assume that the system controller, acting as the leader, first commits to a plan, after which the uncontrollable agents, acting as followers, take a best response based on the committed plan and their own objectives. Our goal is to synthesize a control sequence for the leader such that, for any rational followers producing a best response, the leader's STL task is guaranteed to be satisfied. We present an effective solution to this problem by transforming it into a single-stage optimization problem and leveraging counter-example guided synthesis techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is sound and identify conditions under which it is optimal. Simulation results are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Real-world Troublemaker: A Novel Track Testing Framework for Automated Driving Systems in Safety-critical Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14574v1) | Xinrui Zhang, Lu Xiong et al. | Track testing plays a critical role in the safety evaluation of autonomous driving systems (ADS), as it provides real-world object targets and a safety-controllable interaction environment. However, existing track testing scenarios are often pre-fixed and limited, primarily due to the inflexibility of object target control methods and the lack of intelligent interactive behaviors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel track testing framework, Real-world Troublemaker, which can generate adversarial object target motion trajectories and facilitate intelligent interactions with the vehicle under test (VUT), creating a more realistic and dynamic testing environment. To enable flexible motion trajectories, cloud-controlled technology is utilized to remotely and dynamically control object targets to create a realistic traffic environment. To achieve intelligent interactions, an interactive concrete scenario generation method is introduced within a game-theoretic structure. The proposed framework has been successfully implemented at the Tongji University Intelligent Connected Vehicle Evaluation Base. Field test results demonstrate that Troublemaker can perform dynamic interactive testing of ADS accurately and effectively. Compared to traditional track testing methods, Troublemaker improves scenario reproduction accuracy by 65.2\%, increases the diversity of target vehicle interaction strategies by approximately 9.2 times, and enhances exposure frequency of safety-critical scenarios by 3.5 times in unprotected left-turn scenarios. |
| 2025-02-20 | [CORBA: Contagious Recursive Blocking Attacks on Multi-Agent Systems Based on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14529v1) | Zhenhong Zhou, Zherui Li et al. | Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MASs) have demonstrated remarkable real-world capabilities, effectively collaborating to complete complex tasks. While these systems are designed with safety mechanisms, such as rejecting harmful instructions through alignment, their security remains largely unexplored. This gap leaves LLM-MASs vulnerable to targeted disruptions. In this paper, we introduce Contagious Recursive Blocking Attacks (Corba), a novel and simple yet highly effective attack that disrupts interactions between agents within an LLM-MAS. Corba leverages two key properties: its contagious nature allows it to propagate across arbitrary network topologies, while its recursive property enables sustained depletion of computational resources. Notably, these blocking attacks often involve seemingly benign instructions, making them particularly challenging to mitigate using conventional alignment methods. We evaluate Corba on two widely-used LLM-MASs, namely, AutoGen and Camel across various topologies and commercial models. Additionally, we conduct more extensive experiments in open-ended interactive LLM-MASs, demonstrating the effectiveness of Corba in complex topology structures and open-source models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/Corba. |
| 2025-02-20 | [MLGym: A New Framework and Benchmark for Advancing AI Research Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14499v1) | Deepak Nathani, Lovish Madaan et al. | We introduce Meta MLGym and MLGym-Bench, a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing LLM agents on AI research tasks. This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements. We open-source our framework and benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research capabilities of LLM agents. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Statistical Scenario Modelling and Lookalike Distributions for Multi-Variate AI Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14491v1) | Elija Perrier | Evaluating AI safety requires statistically rigorous methods and risk metrics for understanding how the use of AI affects aggregated risk. However, much AI safety literature focuses upon risks arising from AI models in isolation, lacking consideration of how modular use of AI affects risk distribution of workflow components or overall risk metrics. There is also a lack of statistical grounding enabling sensitisation of risk models in the presence of absence of AI to estimate causal contributions of AI. This is in part due to the dearth of AI impact data upon which to fit distributions. In this work, we address these gaps in two ways. First, we demonstrate how scenario modelling (grounded in established statistical techniques such as Markov chains, copulas and Monte Carlo simulation) can be used to model AI risk holistically. Second, we show how lookalike distributions from phenomena analogous to AI can be used to estimate AI impacts in the absence of directly observable data. We demonstrate the utility of our methods for benchmarking cumulative AI risk via risk analysis of a logistic scenario simulations. |
| 2025-02-20 | [How Jailbreak Defenses Work and Ensemble? A Mechanistic Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14486v1) | Zhuohang Long, Siyuan Wang et al. | Jailbreak attacks, where harmful prompts bypass generative models' built-in safety, raise serious concerns about model vulnerability. While many defense methods have been proposed, the trade-offs between safety and helpfulness, and their application to Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), are not well understood. This paper systematically examines jailbreak defenses by reframing the standard generation task as a binary classification problem to assess model refusal tendencies for both harmful and benign queries. We identify two key defense mechanisms: safety shift, which increases refusal rates across all queries, and harmfulness discrimination, which improves the model's ability to distinguish between harmful and benign inputs. Using these mechanisms, we develop two ensemble defense strategies-inter-mechanism ensembles and intra-mechanism ensembles-to balance safety and helpfulness. Experiments on the MM-SafetyBench and MOSSBench datasets with LLaVA-1.5 models show that these strategies effectively improve model safety or optimize the trade-off between safety and helpfulness. |
| 2025-02-20 | [Natural Language Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14437v1) | Ehud Reiter | This book provides a broad overview of Natural Language Generation (NLG), including technology, user requirements, evaluation, and real-world applications. The focus is on concepts and insights which hopefully will remain relevant for many years, not on the latest LLM innovations. It draws on decades of work by the author and others on NLG.   The book has the following chapters: Introduction to NLG; Rule-Based NLG; Machine Learning and Neural NLG; Requirements; Evaluation; Safety, Maintenance, and Testing; and Applications. All chapters include examples and anecdotes from the author's personal experiences, and end with a Further Reading section.   The book should be especially useful to people working on applied NLG, including NLG researchers, people in other fields who want to use NLG, and commercial developers. It will not however be useful to people who want to understand the latest LLM technology.   There is a companion site with more information at https://ehudreiter.com/book/ |
| 2025-02-20 | [Reliable Explainability of Deep Learning Spatial-Spectral Classifiers for Improved Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14416v1) | Jon GutiÃ©rrez-Zaballa, Koldo Basterretxea et al. | Integrating hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with deep neural networks (DNNs) can strengthen the accuracy of intelligent vision systems by combining spectral and spatial information, which is useful for tasks like semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their reliability. In this paper, we address their limitations and propose an alternative approach by leveraging the data provided by activations and weights from relevant DNN layers to better capture the relationship between input features and predictions. The study aims to assess the superior performance of HSI compared to 3-channel and single-channel DNNs. We also address the influence of spectral signature normalization for enhancing DNN robustness in real-world driving conditions. |
| 2025-02-20 | [HPS: Hard Preference Sampling for Human Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14400v1) | Xiandong Zou, Wanyu Lin et al. | Aligning Large Language Model (LLM) responses with human preferences is vital for building safe and controllable AI systems. While preference optimization methods based on Plackett-Luce (PL) and Bradley-Terry (BT) models have shown promise, they face challenges such as poor handling of harmful content, inefficient use of dispreferred responses, and, specifically for PL, high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose Hard Preference Sampling (HPS), a novel framework for robust and efficient human preference alignment. HPS introduces a training loss that prioritizes the most preferred response while rejecting all dispreferred and harmful ones. It emphasizes "hard" dispreferred responses--those closely resembling preferred ones--to enhance the model's rejection capabilities. By leveraging a single-sample Monte Carlo sampling strategy, HPS reduces computational overhead while maintaining alignment quality. Theoretically, HPS improves sample efficiency over existing PL methods and maximizes the reward margin between preferred and dispreferred responses, ensuring clearer distinctions. Experiments on HH-RLHF and PKU-Safety datasets validate HPS's effectiveness, achieving comparable BLEU and reward scores while greatly improving reward margins and thus reducing harmful content generation. |
| 2025-02-20 | [MPPI-DBaS: Safe Trajectory Optimization with Adaptive Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14387v1) | Fanxin Wang, Yikun Cheng et al. | In trajectory optimization, Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that generates optimal inputs by efficiently simulating numerous trajectories. In practice, however, MPPI often struggles to guarantee safety assurance and balance efficient sampling in open spaces with the need for more extensive exploration under tight constraints. To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard MPPI, achieving a higher success rate and lower tracking errors. |
| 2025-02-20 | [S*: Test Time Scaling for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14382v1) | Dacheng Li, Shiyi Cao et al. | Increasing test-time compute for LLMs shows promise across domains but remains underexplored in code generation, despite extensive study in math. In this paper, we propose S*, the first hybrid test-time scaling framework that substantially improves the coverage and selection accuracy of generated code. S* extends the existing parallel scaling paradigm with sequential scaling to push performance boundaries. It further leverages a novel selection mechanism that adaptively generates distinguishing inputs for pairwise comparison, combined with execution-grounded information to robustly identify correct solutions. We evaluate across 12 Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Model and show: (1) S* consistently improves performance across model families and sizes, enabling a 3B model to outperform GPT-4o-mini; (2) S* enables non-reasoning models to surpass reasoning models - GPT-4o-mini with S* outperforms o1-preview by 3.7% on LiveCodeBench; (3) S* further boosts state-of-the-art reasoning models - DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B with S* achieves 85.7% on LiveCodeBench, approaching o1 (high) at 88.5%. Code will be available under https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought. |
| 2025-02-20 | [ChemHTS: Hierarchical Tool Stacking for Enhancing Chemical Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14327v1) | Zhucong Li, Jin Xiao et al. | Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific research, particularly in chemistry-related tasks such as molecular design, reaction prediction, and property estimation. While tool-augmented LLMs have been introduced to enhance reasoning and computation in these domains, existing approaches suffer from tool invocation errors and lack effective collaboration among diverse tools, limiting their overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose ChemHTS (Chemical Hierarchical Tool Stacking), a novel method that optimizes tool invocation pathways through a hierarchical stacking strategy. ChemHTS consists of two key stages: tool self-stacking warmup and multi-layer decision optimization, enabling LLMs to refine tool usage dynamically. We evaluate ChemHTS across four classical chemistry tasks and demonstrate its superiority over strong baselines, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and chemistry-specific models, including ChemDFM. Furthermore, we define four distinct tool-stacking behaviors to enhance interpretability, providing insights into the effectiveness of tool collaboration. Our dataset and code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Chang-pw/ChemHTS}. |
| 2025-02-20 | [MedHallu: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Detecting Medical Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14302v1) | Shrey Pandit, Jiawei Xu et al. | Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increasing use in medical question-answering necessitate rigorous evaluation of their reliability. A critical challenge lies in hallucination, where models generate plausible yet factually incorrect outputs. In the medical domain, this poses serious risks to patient safety and clinical decision-making. To address this, we introduce MedHallu, the first benchmark specifically designed for medical hallucination detection. MedHallu comprises 10,000 high-quality question-answer pairs derived from PubMedQA, with hallucinated answers systematically generated through a controlled pipeline. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, and the medically fine-tuned UltraMedical, struggle with this binary hallucination detection task, with the best model achieving an F1 score as low as 0.625 for detecting "hard" category hallucinations. Using bidirectional entailment clustering, we show that harder-to-detect hallucinations are semantically closer to ground truth. Through experiments, we also show incorporating domain-specific knowledge and introducing a "not sure" category as one of the answer categories improves the precision and F1 scores by up to 38% relative to baselines. |

Though existing LLM benchmarks are capable of evaluating specific capabilities of LLMs in English as well as in various mid- to low-resource languages, including those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region, a comprehensive and authentic evaluation suite for the SEA languages has not been developed thus far. Here, we present SEA-HELM, a holistic linguistic and cultural LLM evaluation suite that emphasizes SEA languages, comprising five core pillars: (1) NLP Classics, (2) LLM-specifics, (3) SEA Linguistics, (4) SEA Culture, (5) Safety. SEA-HELM currently supports Filipino, Indonesian, Tamil, Thai, and Vietnamese. We also introduce the SEA-HELM leaderboard, which allows users to understand models' multilingual and multicultural performance in a systematic and user-friendly manner. |

To determine gluten's safety, an in-depth in vitro and in vivo toxicological examination is required. This enables scientists to come up with ameliorative strategies if it turns out to have side effects, and consumers' trust can be restored. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity of gluten extracts on albino rats (Rattus norvegicus). Materials and Methods: Twenty-four rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups, each comprising six rats. Group 1 (control) rats were fed on pellet feeds and groups 2, 3, and 4 were fed on daily dosages of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g gluten extracts, respectively. The rats' body weights and reactions were observed for 90 days before blood samples were collected for hematobiochemical and micronucleus tests. Histopathological examinations of the liver and kidneys were also performed. Results: There was no difference (P > 0.05) in body weight, blood glucose level, or micronuclei between the control and treated rats. The lymphocytes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, total protein, and calcium ions of the test rats were all significantly (P < 0.05) altered but remained within the normal ranges. Other hematobiochemical parameters, including packed cell volume, hemoglobin, white and red blood cells, aspartate transaminase, albumin, sodium ions, potassium ions, chloride ions, and urea, revealed no marked changes. The treated rats' livers and kidneys showed no histopathological changes. Conclusion: Gluten had no adverse effects. However, it altered hematobiochemical parameters, particularly the lymphocytes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, total protein, and calcium ions. |

Contrarily, Modulation of Dynamical Systems (Mod-DSs), including normal, reference, and on-manifold Mod-DS, achieve obstacle avoidance with few and even no local minima but have trouble optimally minimizing the difference between the constrained and the unconstrained controller outputs, and its applications are limited to fully-actuated systems. We dive into the theoretical foundations of CBF-QP and Mod-DS, proving that despite their distinct origins, normal Mod-DS is a special case of CBF-QP, and reference Mod-DS's solutions are mathematically connected to that of the CBF-QP through one equation. Building on top of the unveiled theoretical connections between CBF-QP and Mod-DS, reference Mod-based CBF-QP and on-manifold Mod-based CBF-QP controllers are proposed to combine the strength of CBF-QP and Mod-DS approaches and realize local-minimum-free reactive obstacle avoidance for control affine systems in general. We validate our methods in both simulated hospital environments and real-world experiments using Ridgeback for fully-actuated systems and Fetch robots for underactuated systems. Mod-based CBF-QPs outperform CBF-QPs as well as the optimally constrained-enforcing Mod-DS approaches we proposed in all experiments. |

However, their adoption is currently hindered by their lower effective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using conventional theoretical calculations and experimental validation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise to expedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a domain-expert-curated database of $\sim$600 synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room temperature ionic conductivities gathered from literature. Each material is described by their measured composition, space group and lattice parameters. A full-crystal description in the form of a crystallographic information file (CIF) is provided for ~320 structures for which atomic positions were available. We discuss various statistics and features of the dataset and provide training and testing splits that avoid data leakage. Finally, we benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facilitate the use of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery. |

An Empirical Study on Responses to Programming Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14202v1) | Amirali Sajadi, Binh Le et al. | The widespread adoption of conversational LLMs for software development has raised new security concerns regarding the safety of LLM-generated content. Our motivational study outlines ChatGPT's potential in volunteering context-specific information to the developers, promoting safe coding practices. Motivated by this finding, we conduct a study to evaluate the degree of security awareness exhibited by three prominent LLMs: Claude 3, GPT-4, and Llama 3. We prompt these LLMs with Stack Overflow questions that contain vulnerable code to evaluate whether they merely provide answers to the questions or if they also warn users about the insecure code, thereby demonstrating a degree of security awareness. Further, we assess whether LLM responses provide information about the causes, exploits, and the potential fixes of the vulnerability, to help raise users' awareness. Our findings show that all three models struggle to accurately detect and warn users about vulnerabilities, achieving a detection rate of only 12.6% to 40% across our datasets. We also observe that the LLMs tend to identify certain types of vulnerabilities related to sensitive information exposure and improper input neutralization much more frequently than other types, such as those involving external control of file names or paths. Furthermore, when LLMs do issue security warnings, they often provide more information on the causes, exploits, and fixes of vulnerabilities compared to Stack Overflow responses. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion on the implications of our findings and present a CLI-based prompting tool that can be used to generate significantly more secure LLM responses. |

Despite their importance, the research community lacks comprehensive open benchmarks for evaluating multimodal reward models in VLMs. To address this gap, we introduce Multimodal RewardBench, an expert-annotated benchmark covering six domains: general correctness, preference, knowledge, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our dataset comprises 5,211 annotated (prompt, chosen response, rejected response) triplets collected from various VLMs. In evaluating a range of VLM judges, we find that even the top-performing models, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieve only 72% overall accuracy. Notably, most models struggle in the reasoning and safety domains. These findings suggest that Multimodal RewardBench offers a challenging testbed for advancing reward model development across multiple domains. We release the benchmark at https://github.com/facebookresearch/multimodal_rewardbench. |

Despite the advent of sophisticated technologies such as automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, achieving optimal glycemic control remains a formidable task. AID systems integrate continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitors (CGM) data, offering promise in reducing variability and increasing glucose time-in-range. However, these systems often fail to prevent dysglycemia, partly due to limitations in prediction algorithms that lack the precision to avert abnormal glucose events. This gap highlights the need for proactive behavioral adjustments. We address this need with GLIMMER, Glucose Level Indicator Model with Modified Error Rate, a machine learning approach for forecasting blood glucose levels. GLIMMER categorizes glucose values into normal and abnormal ranges and devises a novel custom loss function to prioritize accuracy in dysglycemic events where patient safety is critical. To evaluate the potential of GLIMMER for T1D management, we both use a publicly available dataset and collect new data involving 25 patients with T1D. In predicting next-hour glucose values, GLIMMER achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.97 (+/-3.77) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.83 (+/-2.09) mg/dL. These results reflect a 23% improvement in RMSE and a 31% improvement in MAE compared to the best-reported error rates. |

While prior research on data poisoning attacks has primarily focused on the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs, these attacks face significant challenges in practice. Secure data collection, rigorous data cleaning, and the multistage nature of LLM training make it difficult to inject poisoned data or reliably influence LLM behavior as intended. Given these challenges, this position paper proposes rethinking the role of data poisoning and argue that multi-faceted studies on data poisoning can advance LLM development. From a threat perspective, practical strategies for data poisoning attacks can help evaluate and address real safety risks to LLMs. From a trustworthiness perspective, data poisoning can be leveraged to build more robust LLMs by uncovering and mitigating hidden biases, harmful outputs, and hallucinations. Moreover, from a mechanism perspective, data poisoning can provide valuable insights into LLMs, particularly the interplay between data and model behavior, driving a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms. |

We use this method to automatically create several datasets consisting of questions asking for the truth or falsity of first-order logic statements in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. While the resolution of these questions does not require any knowledge beyond basic notation of first-order logic and set theory, it does require a degree of planning and logical reasoning, which can be controlled up to arbitrarily high difficulty by the complexity of the generated statements. Furthermore, we do extensive evaluations of the performance of various large language models, including recent models such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini, on these datasets. All of the datasets along with the code used for generating them, as well as all data from the evaluations is publicly available at https://github.com/bkuckuck/logical-skills-of-llms. |

These systems pose novel and under-explored risks. In this report, we provide a structured taxonomy of these risks by identifying three key failure modes (miscoordination, conflict, and collusion) based on agents' incentives, as well as seven key risk factors (information asymmetries, network effects, selection pressures, destabilising dynamics, commitment problems, emergent agency, and multi-agent security) that can underpin them. We highlight several important instances of each risk, as well as promising directions to help mitigate them. By anchoring our analysis in a range of real-world examples and experimental evidence, we illustrate the distinct challenges posed by multi-agent systems and their implications for the safety, governance, and ethics of advanced AI. |

To address these issues, we propose PedDet, an adaptive spectral optimization complementarity framework specifically enhanced and optimized for multispectral pedestrian detection. PedDet introduces the Multi-scale Spectral Feature Perception Module (MSFPM) to adaptively fuse visible and infrared features, enhancing robustness and flexibility in feature extraction. Additionally, the Illumination Robustness Feature Decoupling Module (IRFDM) improves detection stability under varying lighting by decoupling pedestrian and background features. We further design a contrastive alignment to enhance intermodal feature discrimination. Experiments on LLVIP and MSDS datasets demonstrate that PedDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the mAP by 6.6% with superior detection accuracy even in low-light conditions, marking a significant step forward for road safety. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PedDet. |

Recent work by Plaut et al. discarded this assumption and presented algorithms that avoid "catastrophe" (i.e., irreparable errors) by asking for help. However, they provided only safety guarantees and did not consider reward maximization. We prove that any algorithm that avoids catastrophe in their setting also guarantees high reward (i.e., sublinear regret) in any Markov Decision Process (MDP), including MDPs with irreversible costs. This constitutes the first no-regret guarantee for general MDPs. More broadly, our result may be the first formal proof that it is possible for an agent to obtain high reward while becoming self-sufficient in an unknown, unbounded, and high-stakes environment without causing catastrophe or requiring resets. |

Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946v1) | Chak Tou Leong, Qingyu Yin et al. | The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region. |

However, its reliance on trial-and-error poses challenges for real-world applications, as errors can result in costly and potentially damaging consequences. To address the need for safer learning, we propose a method that enables agents to learn goal-conditioned behaviors that explore without the risk of making harmful mistakes. Exploration without risks can seem paradoxical, but environment dynamics are often uniform in space, therefore a policy trained for safety without exploration purposes can still be exploited globally. Our proposed approach involves two distinct phases. First, during a pretraining phase, we employ safe reinforcement learning and distributional techniques to train a safety policy that actively tries to avoid failures in various situations. In the subsequent safe exploration phase, a goal-conditioned (GC) policy is learned while ensuring safety. To achieve this, we implement an action-selection mechanism leveraging the previously learned distributional safety critics to arbitrate between the safety policy and the GC policy, ensuring safe exploration by switching to the safety policy when needed. We evaluate our method in simulated environments and demonstrate that it not only provides substantial coverage of the goal space but also reduces the occurrence of mistakes to a minimum, in stark contrast to traditional GCRL approaches. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and analyze failure modes, offering insights for future research directions. |

However, aerial users (AUs) experience significant interference from numerous terrestrial base stations (BSs). To alleviate such interference, we investigate a user association and coordinated beamforming (CBF) problem in CATN, where the aerial network serves as the primary network sharing its spectrum with the terrestrial network. Specifically, we maximize the sum rate of the secondary terrestrial users (TUs) under the interference temperature constraints of the AUs. Traditional iterative optimization schemes are impractical due to their high computational complexity and information exchange overhead. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes can address these challenges, their performance is sensitive to the weights of the weighted penalty terms for violating constraints in the reward function. Motivated by these issues, we propose a safe DRL-based user association and CBF scheme for CATN, eliminating the need for training multiple times to find the optimal penalty weight before actual deployment. Specifically, the CATN is modeled as a networked constrained partially observable Markov game. Each TU acts as an agent to choose its associated BS, and each BS acts as an agent to decide its beamforming vectors, aiming to maximize the reward while satisfying the safety constraints introduced by the interference constraints of the AUs. By exploiting a safe DRL algorithm, the proposed scheme incurs lower deployment expenses than the penalty-based DRL schemes since only one training is required before actual deployment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher sum rate of TUs than a two-stage optimization scheme while the average received interference power of the AUs is generally below the threshold. |

These services heavily rely on map-based traffic information to reduce uncertainties in recognizing lane shapes, traffic light locations, and traffic signs. Achieving this level of reliance on map information requires centimeter-level localization accuracy, which is currently only achievable with LiDAR sensors. However, LiDAR is known to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks that emit malicious lasers against LiDAR to overwrite its measurements. Once localization is compromised, the attack could lead the victim off roads or make them ignore traffic lights. Motivated by these serious safety implications, we design SLAMSpoof, the first practical LiDAR spoofing attack on localization systems for self-driving to assess the actual attack significance on autonomous vehicles. SLAMSpoof can effectively find the effective attack location based on our scan matching vulnerability score (SMVS), a point-wise metric representing the potential vulnerability to spoofing attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the attack, we conduct real-world experiments on ground vehicles and confirm its high capability in real-world scenarios, inducing position errors of $\geq$4.2 meters (more than typical lane width) for all 3 popular LiDAR-based localization algorithms. We finally discuss the potential countermeasures of this attack. Code is available at https://github.com/Keio-CSG/slamspoof |

While significant progress has been made in developing taxonomies for LLM risks and safety evaluation prompts, most studies have focused on monolingual contexts, primarily in English. However, language- and region-specific risks in bilingual contexts are often overlooked, and core findings can diverge from those in monolingual settings. In this paper, we introduce Qorgau, a novel dataset specifically designed for safety evaluation in Kazakh and Russian, reflecting the unique bilingual context in Kazakhstan, where both Kazakh (a low-resource language) and Russian (a high-resource language) are spoken. Experiments with both multilingual and language-specific LLMs reveal notable differences in safety performance, emphasizing the need for tailored, region-specific datasets to ensure the responsible and safe deployment of LLMs in countries like Kazakhstan. Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive, harmful, or biased. |

To address the security challenges of the confidential information transmission caused by the inherent openness nature of wireless medium, different from current physical layer security (PLS) methods, which depends on the \emph{additional communication interference} costing extra power resources, in this paper, we investigate a novel PLS solution, under which the \emph{inherent radar sensing interference} of the vehicles is utilized to secure wireless communications. To measure the performance of PLS methods in ISAC-based IoV systems, we first define an improved security performance metric called by transmission reliability and sensing accuracy based secrecy rate (TRSA\_SR), and derive closed-form expressions of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), success ranging probability (SRP) for evaluating transmission reliability, security and sensing accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the TRSA\_SR by utilizing radar sensing interference and joint design of the communication duration, transmission power and straight trajectory of the legitimate transmitter. Finally, the non-convex feature of formulated problem is solved through the problem decomposition and alternating optimization. Simulations indicate that compared with traditional PLS methods obtaining a non-positive STC, the proposed method achieves a secrecy rate of 3.92bps/Hz for different settings of noise power. |

Its simplicity enables easy adaptation to various domains and safety requirements. This paper examines DPO's effectiveness in model safety against jailbreaking attacks while minimizing data requirements and training costs. We introduce Egida, a dataset expanded from multiple sources, which includes 27 different safety topics and 18 different attack styles, complemented with synthetic and human labels. This data is used to boost the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B/72B-Instruct) across topics and attack styles. In addition to safety evaluations, we assess their post-alignment performance degradation in general purpose tasks, and their tendency to over refusal. Following the proposed methodology, trained models reduce their Attack Success Rate by 10%-30%, using small training efforts (2,000 samples) with low computational cost (3\$ for 8B models, 20\$ for 72B models). Safety aligned models generalize to unseen topics and attack styles, with the most successful attack style reaching a success rate around 5%. Size and family are found to strongly influence model malleability towards safety, pointing at the importance of pre-training choices. To validate our findings, a large independent assessment of human preference agreement with Llama-Guard-3-8B is conducted by the authors and the associated dataset Egida-HSafe is released. Overall, this study illustrates how affordable and accessible it is to enhance LLM safety using DPO while outlining its current limitations. All datasets and models are released to enable reproducibility and further research. |

These attacks utilize prompt engineering and logit manipulation to steer models toward harmful content, prompting LLM providers to implement filtering and safety alignment strategies. We investigate LLMs' safety mechanisms and their recent applications, revealing a new threat model targeting structured output interfaces, which enable attackers to manipulate the inner logit during LLM generation, requiring only API access permissions. To demonstrate this threat model, we introduce a black-box attack framework called AttackPrefixTree (APT). APT exploits structured output interfaces to dynamically construct attack patterns. By leveraging prefixes of models' safety refusal response and latent harmful outputs, APT effectively bypasses safety measures. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that this approach achieves higher attack success rate than existing methods. This work highlights the urgent need for LLM providers to enhance security protocols to address vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between safety patterns and structured outputs. |

AI has been an integral part of many applications that rely on automation for service delivery, and one of them is mission-critical public safety applications. The problem with AI-oriented mission-critical applications is the humanin-the-loop system and the lack of adaptability to dynamic conditions while maintaining situational awareness. Agentic AI (AAI) has gained a lot of attention recently due to its ability to analyze textual data through a contextual lens while quickly adapting to conditions. In this context, this paper proposes an AAI framework for mission-critical applications. We propose a novel framework with a multi-layer architecture to realize the AAI. We also present a detailed implementation of AAI layer that bridges the gap between network infrastructure and missioncritical applications. Our preliminary analysis shows that the AAI reduces initial response time by 5.6 minutes on average, while alert generation time is reduced by 15.6 seconds on average and resource allocation is improved by up to 13.4%. We also show that the AAI methods improve the number of concurrent operations by 40, which reduces the recovery time by up to 5.2 minutes. Finally, we highlight some of the issues and challenges that need to be considered when implementing AAI frameworks. |

In this context, evaluations are mostly based on single-value metrics such as QA accuracy. However, these metrics often fail to capture the nuanced retention of harmful knowledge components, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of unlearning. To address this issue, we propose UNCD (UNlearning evaluation via Cognitive Diagnosis), a novel framework that leverages Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling for fine-grained evaluation of LLM unlearning. Our dedicated benchmark, UNCD-Cyber, provides a detailed assessment of the removal of dangerous capabilities. Moreover, we introduce UNCD-Agent, which refines unlearning by diagnosing knowledge remnants and generating targeted unlearning data. Extensive experiments across eight unlearning methods and two base models demonstrate that UNCD not only enhances evaluation but also effectively facilitates the removal of harmful LLM abilities. |

Existing guardrails rely on rule-based filtering or single-pass classification, limiting their ability to handle nuanced safety violations. To address this, we propose ThinkGuard, a critique-augmented guardrail model that distills knowledge from high-capacity LLMs by generating structured critiques alongside safety labels. Fine-tuned on critique-augmented data, the captured deliberative thinking ability drastically enhances the guardrail's cautiousness and interpretability. Evaluated on multiple safety benchmarks, ThinkGuard achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC, outperforming all baselines. Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, ThinkGuard improves accuracy by 16.1% and macro F1 by 27.0%. Moreover, it surpasses label-only fine-tuned models, confirming that structured critiques enhance both classification precision and nuanced safety reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency. |

A key concern is that models often produce confident, yet unfounded, answers to unanswerable problems. We introduce TreeCut, a synthetic dataset that systematically generates infinite unanswerable math word problems and their answerable counterparts, by representing each question as a tree and removing chosen necessary conditions. Experiments show TreeCut effectively induce hallucinations in large language models, including GPT-4o and o3-mini, with rates of 61% and 42% in their respective worst-case scenarios. Further analysis highlights that deeper or more complex trees, composite item names, and removing necessary condition near the middle of a path all increase the likelihood of hallucinations, underscoring the persistent challenges LLMs face in identifying unanswerable math problems. |

Existing assessment methods, however, rely heavily on subjective human judgment, which introduces bias and limits reproducibility. While recent efforts have leveraged kinematic data and neural imaging to provide more objective evaluations, these approaches often overlook the dynamic neural mechanisms that differentiate expert and novice performance. This study proposes a novel method for motor skill assessment based on dynamic directed functional connectivity (dFC) as a neural biomarker. By using electroencephalography (EEG) to capture brain dynamics and employing an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for non-linear Granger causality analysis, we compute dFC among key brain regions involved in psychomotor tasks. Coupled with hierarchical task analysis (HTA), our approach enables subtask-level evaluation of motor skills, offering detailed insights into neural coordination that underpins expert proficiency. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used to classify skill levels, achieving greater accuracy and specificity than established performance metrics in laparoscopic surgery. This methodology provides a reliable, objective framework for assessing motor skills, contributing to the development of tailored training protocols and enhancing the certification process. |

Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) systems, enabled by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a promising solution for assessing and providing instant feedback for open-ended student responses. In this paper, we present an ASAG pipeline leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs. Our new LLM-based ASAG pipeline achieves better performances than existing custom-built models on the same datasets. We also compare the grading performance of three OpenAI models: GPT-4, GPT-4o, and o1-preview. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4o achieves the best balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, o1-preview, despite higher accuracy, exhibits a larger variance in error that makes it less practical for classroom use. We investigate the effects of incorporating instructor-graded examples into prompts using no examples, random selection, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based selection strategies. Our findings indicate that providing graded examples enhances grading accuracy, with RAG-based selection outperforming random selection. Additionally, integrating grading rubrics improves accuracy by offering a structured standard for evaluation. |

We find reasoning models like o1 preview and DeepSeek-R1 will often hack the benchmark by default, while language models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet need to be told that normal play won't work to hack.   We improve upon prior work like (Hubinger et al., 2024; Meinke et al., 2024; Weij et al., 2024) by using realistic task prompts and avoiding excess nudging. Our results suggest reasoning models may resort to hacking to solve difficult problems, as observed in OpenAI (2024)'s o1 Docker escape during cyber capabilities testing. |

In this work, we establish a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) training paradigm. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards that guide the policy to effectively respond to safety-critical events and understand real-world causal relationships. For better alignment with human driving behavior, IL is incorporated into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, especially 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented at https://hgao-cv.github.io/RAD. |

Despite these basic abilities, humanoids are still required to quickly understand human instructions and react based on human interaction signals to become valuable assistants in human daily life. Unfortunately, most existing works only focus on multi-stage interactions, treating each task separately, and neglecting real-time feedback. In this work, we aim to empower humanoid robots with real-time reaction abilities to achieve various tasks, allowing human to interrupt robots at any time, and making robots respond to humans immediately. To support such abilities, we propose a general humanoid-human-object interaction framework, named RHINO, i.e., Real-time Humanoid-human Interaction and Object manipulation. RHINO provides a unified view of reactive motion, instruction-based manipulation, and safety concerns, over multiple human signal modalities, such as languages, images, and motions. RHINO is a hierarchical learning framework, enabling humanoids to learn reaction skills from human-human-object demonstrations and teleoperation data. In particular, it decouples the interaction process into two levels: 1) a high-level planner inferring human intentions from real-time human behaviors; and 2) a low-level controller achieving reactive motion behaviors and object manipulation skills based on the predicted intentions. We evaluate the proposed framework on a real humanoid robot and demonstrate its effectiveness, flexibility, and safety in various scenarios. |

However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range. While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference. These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models. We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without additional training. Our results highlight DRMs as a powerful framework for personalized and interpretable LLM alignment. |

To uncover the root cause of this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis and identify a key issue: multimodal inputs introduce an modality-induced activation shift toward a "safer" direction compared to their text-only counterparts, leading VLMs to systematically overestimate the safety of harmful inputs. We refer to this issue as safety perception distortion. To mitigate such distortion, we propose Activation Shift Disentanglement and Calibration (ShiftDC), a training-free method that decomposes and calibrates the modality-induced activation shift to reduce the impact of modality on safety. By isolating and removing the safety-relevant component, ShiftDC restores the inherent safety alignment of the LLM backbone while preserving the vision-language capabilities of VLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that ShiftDC significantly enhances alignment performance on safety benchmarks without impairing model utility. |

Motivated by the challenging domain of lane-free traffic where automated vehicles can communicate and coordinate as agents, we propose a more realistic communication framework for Factor Graph formulations that satisfies the above-mentioned restrictions, along with Conditional Max-Sum: an extension of Max-Sum with a revised message-passing process that is better suited for asynchronous settings. The overall application in lane-free traffic can be viewed as a hybrid system where the Factor Graph formulation undertakes the strategic decision making of vehicles, that of desired lateral alignment in a coordinated manner; and acts on top of a rule-based method we devise that provides a structured representation of the lane-free environment for the factors, while also handling the underlying control of vehicles regarding core operations and safety. Our experimental evaluation showcases the capabilities of the proposed framework in problems with intense coordination needs when compared to a domain-specific baseline without communication, and an increased adeptness of Conditional Max-Sum with respect to the standard algorithm. |

Making unwarranted assumptions and failing to ask clarifying questions can lead to suboptimal outcomes, safety risks due to tool misuse, and wasted computational resources. In this work, we study the ability of LLM agents to handle ambiguous instructions in interactive code generation settings by evaluating proprietary and open-weight models on their performance across three key steps: (a) leveraging interactivity to improve performance in ambiguous scenarios, (b) detecting ambiguity, and (c) asking targeted questions. Our findings reveal that models struggle to distinguish between well-specified and underspecified instructions. However, when models interact for underspecified inputs, they effectively obtain vital information from the user, leading to significant improvements in performance and underscoring the value of effective interaction. Our study highlights critical gaps in how current state-of-the-art models handle ambiguity in complex software engineering tasks and structures the evaluation into distinct steps to enable targeted improvements. |

Traditional inspection methods, such as manual observations or helicopter surveys, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. This paper explores the use of 3D computer vision to automate power grid inspections, utilizing the TS40K dataset -- a high-density, annotated collection of 3D LiDAR point clouds. By concentrating on 3D semantic segmentation, our approach addresses challenges like class imbalance and noisy data to enhance the detection of critical grid components such as power lines and towers. The benchmark results indicate significant performance improvements, with IoU scores reaching 95.53% for the detection of power lines using transformer-based models. Our findings illustrate the potential for integrating ML into grid maintenance workflows, increasing efficiency and enabling proactive risk management strategies. |

Traditional performance metrics, such as accuracy, focus on overall error rates but fail to account for the confidence of incorrect predictions, thereby overlooking the risk of confident misjudgments. This risk is particularly significant in cost-sensitive and safety-critical domains like medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, where overconfident false predictions may cause severe consequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Fragility Index (FI), a novel metric that evaluates classification performance from a risk-averse perspective by explicitly capturing the tail risk of confident misjudgments. To enhance generalizability, we define FI within the robust satisficing (RS) framework, incorporating data uncertainty. We further develop a model training approach that optimizes FI while maintaining tractability for common loss functions. Specifically, we derive exact reformulations for cross-entropy loss, hinge-type loss, and Lipschitz loss, and extend the approach to deep learning models. Through synthetic experiments and real-world medical diagnosis tasks, we demonstrate that FI effectively identifies misjudgment risk and FI-based training improves model robustness and generalizability. Finally, we extend our framework to deep neural network training, further validating its effectiveness in enhancing deep learning models. |

However, leveraging these reasoning capabilities to enhance LLM safety against adversarial attacks and jailbreak queries remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-to-Defend (R2D), a novel training paradigm that integrates safety reflections of queries and responses into LLMs' generation process, unlocking a safety-aware reasoning mechanism. This approach enables self-evaluation at each reasoning step to create safety pivot tokens as indicators of the response's safety status. Furthermore, in order to improve the learning efficiency of pivot token prediction, we propose Contrastive Pivot Optimization(CPO), which enhances the model's ability to perceive the safety status of dialogues. Through this mechanism, LLMs dynamically adjust their response strategies during reasoning, significantly enhancing their defense capabilities against jailbreak attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that R2D effectively mitigates various attacks and improves overall safety, highlighting the substantial potential of safety-aware reasoning in strengthening LLMs' robustness against jailbreaks. |

Prior research has associated hallucinations with model uncertainty, leveraging this relationship for hallucination detection and mitigation. In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that all hallucinations are associated with uncertainty. Using knowledge detection and uncertainty measurement methods, we demonstrate that models can hallucinate with high certainty even when they have the correct knowledge. We further show that high-certainty hallucinations are consistent across models and datasets, distinctive enough to be singled out, and challenge existing mitigation methods. Our findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety. The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/Trust_me_Im_wrong . |

The rise of high-quality AI-generated content has spurred interest in AI-driven micro-video creation. However, despite the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek in text generation and reasoning, their potential to assist the creation of popular micro-videos remains largely unexplored.   In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 enable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created content. Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo lead in video generation. This pioneering work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities. We will release the code and datasets to support future studies. |

Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers. |

While this new approach offers a promising route for balancing model utility and safety, its robustness remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Malicious-Educator, a benchmark that disguises extremely dangerous or malicious requests beneath seemingly legitimate educational prompts. Our experiments reveal severe security flaws in popular commercial-grade LRMs, including OpenAI o1/o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. For instance, although OpenAI's o1 model initially maintains a high refusal rate of about 98%, subsequent model updates significantly compromise its safety; and attackers can easily extract criminal strategies from DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking without any additional tricks. To further highlight these vulnerabilities, we propose Hijacking Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT), a universal and transferable attack method that leverages the model's own displayed intermediate reasoning to jailbreak its safety reasoning mechanism. Under H-CoT, refusal rates sharply decline-dropping from 98% to below 2%-and, in some instances, even transform initially cautious tones into ones that are willing to provide harmful content. We hope these findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety mechanisms to preserve the benefits of advanced reasoning capabilities without compromising ethical standards. |

However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real performance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and opportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this direction. We are actively maintaining a to include the most up-to-date sim-to-real research outcomes to help the researchers in their work. |

Low perceived switching frictions can lead to choices that do not consider more subtle behavior changes that the transition may induce. Our experiments use a popular game-theoretic behavioral economics model of trust to show stark differences in the trusting behavior of OpenAI's and DeepSeek's models. We highlight a collapse in the economic trust behavior of the o1-mini and o3-mini models as they reconcile profit-maximizing and risk-seeking with future returns from trust, and contrast it with DeepSeek's more sophisticated and profitable trusting behavior that stems from an ability to incorporate deeper concepts like forward planning and theory-of-mind. As LLMs form the basis for high-stakes commercial systems, our results highlight the perils of relying on LLM performance benchmarks that are too narrowly defined and suggest that careful analysis of their hidden fault lines should be part of any organization's AI strategy. |

We propose a comprehensive novel approach to user simulation technique that uses LLMs to create diverse user profiles, set goals, engage in multi-turn dialogues, and evaluate the conversation success. We employ two proprietary LLMs, namely GPT-4o and GPT-o1 (Achiam et al., 2023), to generate a heterogeneous base of user profiles, characterized by varied demographics, multiple user goals, different conversational styles, initial knowledge levels, interests, and conversational objectives. We perform a detailed analysis of the user profiles generated by LLMs to assess the diversity, consistency, and potential biases inherent in these LLM-generated user simulations. We find that GPT-o1 generates more heterogeneous user distribution across most user attributes, while GPT-4o generates more skewed user attributes. The generated set of user profiles are then utilized to simulate dialogue sessions by interacting with a task-oriented dialogue system. |

Among other things, artificial intelligence enables an ever-increasing degree of autonomy. In this context, the V-model, which has served for decades as a process reference model of the system development lifecycle is reaching its limits. To the contrary, innovative processes and frameworks have been developed that take into account the characteristics of emerging autonomous systems. To bridge the gap and merge the different methodologies, we present an extension of the V-model for iterative data-based development processes that harmonizes and formalizes the existing methods towards a generic framework. The iterative approach allows for seamless integration of continuous system refinement. While the data-based approach constitutes the consideration of data-based development processes and formalizes the use of synthetic and real world data. In this way, formalizing the process of development, verification, validation, and continuous integration contributes to ensuring the safety of emerging complex systems that incorporate AI. |

Prebunking, a type of psychological immunization, can educate people about misinformation and lay a foundation of cognitive resilience that makes them more robust against future misinformation. We use a compartmental modeling approach inspired by vaccination models from epidemiology to model the effectiveness of prebunking misinformation. Populations are classified into different compartments based on the exposure to prebunking and the propagation of misinformation through online social networks. Specific rates dictate the transitions between such states, similar to how people traverse between susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments in classical epidemiological models. This model integrates different levels of prebunking potency, the fraction of the population prebunked initially, and the forgetting rate effects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work which study the extent of prebunking interventions to reduce the scale of misinformation, much as vaccinations curtail the spread of infectious diseases. |

Most datasets are from four-wheeler drivers on well-planned roads and homogeneous traffic. Our dataset offers a critical lens into the unique visual attention patterns and insights into the decision-making of Indian two-wheeler drivers. The analysis demonstrates that existing saliency models, like TASED-Net, perform less effectively on the myEye-2Wheeler dataset compared to when applied on the European 4-wheeler eye tracking datasets (DR(Eye)VE), highlighting the need for models specifically tailored to the traffic conditions. By introducing the dataset, we not only fill a significant gap in two-wheeler driver behaviour research in India but also emphasise the critical need for developing context-specific saliency models. The larger aim is to improve road safety for two-wheeler users and lane-planning to support a cost-effective mode of transport. |

Most of these approaches use position-based control, where policies output target joint angles that must be processed by a low-level controller (e.g., PD or impedance controllers) to compute joint torques. Although impressive results have been achieved in controlled real-world scenarios, these methods often struggle with compliance and adaptability when encountering environments or disturbances unseen during training, potentially resulting in extreme or unsafe behaviors. Inspired by how animals achieve smooth and adaptive movements by controlling muscle extension and contraction, torque-based policies offer a promising alternative by enabling precise and direct control of the actuators in torque space. In principle, this approach facilitates more effective interactions with the environment, resulting in safer and more adaptable behaviors. However, challenges such as a highly nonlinear state space and inefficient exploration during training have hindered their broader adoption. To address these limitations, we propose SATA, a bio-inspired framework that mimics key biomechanical principles and adaptive learning mechanisms observed in animal locomotion. Our approach effectively addresses the inherent challenges of learning torque-based policies by significantly improving early-stage exploration, leading to high-performance final policies. Remarkably, our method achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our experimental results indicate that SATA demonstrates remarkable compliance and safety, even in challenging environments such as soft/slippery terrain or narrow passages, and under significant external disturbances, highlighting its potential for practical deployments in human-centric and safety-critical scenarios. |

However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source R1 models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on R1 is needed. (2) The distilled reasoning model shows poorer safety performance compared to its safety-aligned base models. (3) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions.

The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95 reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38 higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management. |

We hypothesize that dynamic handover, where the robot adjusts to the receiver's movements, results in more efficient and comfortable interaction compared to static handover, where the receiver is assumed to be stationary. To validate this, we developed a nonparametric method for generating continuous handover motion, conditioned on the receiver's movements, and trained the model using a dataset of 1,000 human-to-human handover demonstrations. We integrated preference learning for improved handover effectiveness and applied impedance control to ensure user safety and adaptiveness. The approach was evaluated in both simulation and real-world settings, with user studies demonstrating that dynamic handover significantly reduces handover time and improves user comfort compared to static methods. Videos and demonstrations of our approach are available at https://zerotohero7886.github.io/dyn-r2h-handover . |

However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

While the "personification" enhances human experiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to critical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment and toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different personality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs. Leveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social psychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs' performance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the sensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more importantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and toxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several personality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model performance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and toxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content safety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM personification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of personalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text generation. |
| 2025-02-18 | [Self Iterative Label Refinement via Robust Unlabeled Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12565v1) | Hikaru Asano, Tadashi Kozuno et al. | Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance on various tasks, yet they often depend on high-quality feedback that can be costly. Self-refinement methods attempt to leverage LLMs' internal evaluation mechanisms with minimal human supervision; however, these approaches frequently suffer from inherent biases and overconfidence, especially in domains where the models lack sufficient internal knowledge, resulting in performance degradation. As an initial step toward enhancing self-refinement for broader applications, we introduce an iterative refinement pipeline that employs the Unlabeled-Unlabeled learning framework to improve LLM-generated pseudo-labels for classification tasks. By exploiting two unlabeled datasets with differing positive class ratios, our approach iteratively denoises and refines the initial pseudo-labels, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of internal biases with minimal human supervision. Evaluations on diverse datasets, including low-resource language corpora, patent classifications, and protein structure categorizations, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both initial LLM's classification performance and the self-refinement approaches by cutting-edge models (e.g., GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1). |

Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA. |

Despite the transformative applications of LLMs in various aspects of children's lives such as education and therapy, there remains a significant gap in understanding and mitigating potential content harms specific to this demographic. The study acknowledges the diverse nature of children often overlooked by standard safety evaluations and proposes a comprehensive approach to evaluating LLM safety specifically for children. We list down potential risks that children may encounter when using LLM powered applications. Additionally we develop Child User Models that reflect the varied personalities and interests of children informed by literature in child care and psychology. These user models aim to bridge the existing gap in child safety literature across various fields. We utilize Child User Models to evaluate the safety of six state of the art LLMs. Our observations reveal significant safety gaps in LLMs particularly in categories harmful to children but not adults |

Recent advances in inference-time techniques demonstrate the potential to enhance LLM reasoning without additional training by exploring intermediate steps during inference. Notably, OpenAI's o1 model shows promising performance through its novel use of multi-step reasoning and verification. Here, we explore how scaling inference-time techniques can improve reasoning and planning, focusing on understanding the tradeoff between computational cost and performance. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, known as Sys2Bench, and perform extensive experiments evaluating existing inference-time techniques on eleven diverse tasks across five categories, including arithmetic reasoning, logical reasoning, common sense reasoning, algorithmic reasoning, and planning. Our findings indicate that simply scaling inference-time computation has limitations, as no single inference-time technique consistently performs well across all reasoning and planning tasks. |
| 2025-02-18 | [SAFEERASER: Enhancing Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models through Multimodal Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12520v1) | Junkai Chen, Zhijie Deng et al. | As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended. |

Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) imaging is commonly used for non-destructive testing, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the combined effects of inspection speed and sampling rate. To address this issue, the impacts of inspection speed and sampling rate on image quality are studied, as variations in these factors can cause stripe noise, axial compression of defect features, and increased interference, complicating accurate detection. We define the relationship between inspection speed and sampling rate as spatial sampling resolution (SSR) and propose an adaptive SSR target-feature-oriented (AS-TFO) method. This method incorporates adaptive adjustment and pyramid image fusion techniques to enhance defect detection under different SSR scenarios. Experimental results show that under high SSR scenarios, the method achieves a precision of 92.54% and recall of 98.41%. It remains robust under low SSR scenarios with a precision of 94.87% and recall of 97.37%. The overall results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This improvement in detection accuracy and robustness is particularly valuable for handling complex inspection conditions, where inspection speed and sampling rate can vary significantly, making detection more robust and reliable in industrial settings. |
| 2025-02-18 | [Towards Robust and Secure Embodied AI: A Survey on Vulnerabilities and Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13175v1) | Wenpeng Xing, Minghao Li et al. | Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a range of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level factors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI. |
| 2025-02-18 | [SoK: Understanding Vulnerabilities in the Large Language Model Supply Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12497v1) | Shenao Wang, Yanjie Zhao et al. | Large Language Models (LLMs) transform artificial intelligence, driving advancements in natural language understanding, text generation, and autonomous systems. The increasing complexity of their development and deployment introduces significant security challenges, particularly within the LLM supply chain. However, existing research primarily focuses on content safety, such as adversarial attacks, jailbreaking, and backdoor attacks, while overlooking security vulnerabilities in the underlying software systems. To address this gap, this study systematically analyzes 529 vulnerabilities reported across 75 prominent projects spanning 13 lifecycle stages. The findings show that vulnerabilities are concentrated in the application (50.3%) and model (42.7%) layers, with improper resource control (45.7%) and improper neutralization (25.1%) identified as the leading root causes. Additionally, while 56.7% of the vulnerabilities have available fixes, 8% of these patches are ineffective, resulting in recurring vulnerabilities. This study underscores the challenges of securing the LLM ecosystem and provides actionable insights to guide future research and mitigation strategies. |
| 2025-02-18 | [Safe at the Margins: A General Approach to Safety Alignment in Low-Resource English Languages -- A Singlish Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12485v1) | Isaac Lim, Shaun Khoo et al. | To ensure safe usage, Large Language Models (LLMs) typically undergo alignment with human-defined values. However, this alignment often relies on primarily English data and is biased towards Western-centric values, limiting its effectiveness in low-resource language settings. In this paper, we describe our approach for aligning SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct (a Llama3-8B variant) to minimize toxicity in Singlish, an English creole specific to Singapore. We find that supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) on paired and unpaired preferences is more sample efficient and yields significantly better results than Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our analysis reveals that DPO implicitly enforces a weaker safety objective than KTO, and that SFT complements KTO by improving training stability. Finally, we introduce a simple but novel modification to KTO, KTO-S, which improves training stability through better gradient exploitation. Overall, we present a general approach for safety alignment conducive to low-resource English languages, successfully reducing toxicity by 99\% on our Singlish benchmark, with gains generalizing to the broader TOXIGEN dataset while maintaining strong performance across standard LLM benchmarks. |

Inspired by recent advances in reasoning models and shifts in scaling laws, we pioneer bringing test-time computation into LLM-as-a-Judge, proposing MCTS-Judge, a resource-efficient, System-2 thinking framework for code correctness evaluation. MCTS-Judge leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to decompose problems into simpler, multi-perspective evaluations. Through a node-selection strategy that combines self-assessment based on historical actions in the current trajectory and the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees based on prior rollouts, MCTS-Judge balances global optimization and refinement of the current trajectory. We further designed a high-precision, unit-test-level reward mechanism to encourage the Large Language Model (LLM) to perform line-by-line analysis. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks and five LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of MCTS-Judge, which improves the base model's accuracy from 41% to 80%, surpassing the o1-series models with 3x fewer tokens. Further evaluations validate the superiority of its reasoning trajectory in logic, analytics, thoroughness, and overall quality, while revealing the test-time scaling law of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. |

We present the task of equivalence checking as a new way to evaluate the code reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We introduce EquiBench, a dataset of 2400 program pairs spanning four programming languages and six equivalence categories. These pairs are systematically generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, covering nontrivial structural transformations that demand deep semantic reasoning beyond simple syntactic variations. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs shows that OpenAI o3-mini achieves the highest overall accuracy of 78.0%. In the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 62.3% and 68.8%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline for binary classification, indicating significant room for improvement in current models' code reasoning capabilities. |

While large safety guard models achieve strong performance, their computational cost is substantial. To mitigate this, smaller distilled models are used, but they often underperform on "hard" examples where the larger model provides accurate predictions. We observe that many inputs can be reliably handled by the smaller model, while only a small fraction require the larger model's capacity. Motivated by this, we propose SafeRoute, a binary router that distinguishes hard examples from easy ones. Our method selectively applies the larger safety guard model to the data that the router considers hard, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy compared to solely using the larger safety guard model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our adaptive model selection significantly enhances the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance, outperforming relevant baselines. |
| 2025-02-18 | [Computational Safety for Generative AI: A Signal Processing Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12445v1) | Pin-Yu Chen | AI safety is a rapidly growing area of research that seeks to prevent the harm and misuse of frontier AI technology, particularly with respect to generative AI (GenAI) tools that are capable of creating realistic and high-quality content through text prompts. Examples of such tools include large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. As the performance of various leading GenAI models approaches saturation due to similar training data sources and neural network architecture designs, the development of reliable safety guardrails has become a key differentiator for responsibility and sustainability. This paper presents a formalization of the concept of computational safety, which is a mathematical framework that enables the quantitative assessment, formulation, and study of safety challenges in GenAI through the lens of signal processing theory and methods. In particular, we explore two exemplary categories of computational safety challenges in GenAI that can be formulated as hypothesis testing problems. For the safety of model input, we show how sensitivity analysis and loss landscape analysis can be used to detect malicious prompts with jailbreak attempts. For the safety of model output, we elucidate how statistical signal processing and adversarial learning can be used to detect AI-generated content. Finally, we discuss key open research challenges, opportunities, and the essential role of signal processing in computational AI safety. |
| 2025-02-18 | [Gradient Co-occurrence Analysis for Detecting Unsafe Prompts in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12411v1) | Jingyuan Yang, Bowen Yan et al. | Unsafe prompts pose significant safety risks to large language models (LLMs). Existing methods for detecting unsafe prompts rely on data-driven fine-tuning to train guardrail models, necessitating significant data and computational resources. In contrast, recent few-shot gradient-based methods emerge, requiring only few safe and unsafe reference prompts. A gradient-based approach identifies unsafe prompts by analyzing consistent patterns of the gradients of safety-critical parameters in LLMs. Although effective, its restriction to directional similarity (cosine similarity) introduces ``directional bias'', limiting its capability to identify unsafe prompts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce GradCoo, a novel gradient co-occurrence analysis method that expands the scope of safety-critical parameter identification to include unsigned gradient similarity, thereby reducing the impact of ``directional bias'' and enhancing the accuracy of unsafe prompt detection. Comprehensive experiments on the widely-used benchmark datasets ToxicChat and XStest demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, we confirm the generalizability of GradCoo in detecting unsafe prompts across a range of LLM base models with various sizes and origins. |

We focus on an offline setting where the agent has only a fixed dataset -- common in realistic tasks to prevent unsafe exploration. To address this, we propose Diffusion-Regularized Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning (DRCORL), which first uses a diffusion model to capture the behavioral policy from offline data and then extracts a simplified policy to enable efficient inference. We further apply gradient manipulation for safety adaptation, balancing the reward objective and constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages high-quality offline data while incorporating safety requirements. Empirical results show that DRCORL achieves reliable safety performance, fast inference, and strong reward outcomes across robot learning tasks. Compared to existing safe offline RL methods, it consistently meets cost limits and performs well with the same hyperparameters, indicating practical applicability in real-world scenarios. |

Machine-learning and large-language models (LLMs) also have their respective limitations. This paper explores the application of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning model in chemical engineering, starting from 30 experimental data points. By integrating traditional surrogate models like Gaussian processes and random forests with powerful LLMs such as DeepSeek-R1, a hierarchical architecture is proposed. Two CoT-building methods, Large Language Model-Chain of Thought (LLM-CoT) and Machine Learning-Large Language Model-Chain of Thought (ML-LLM-CoT), are studied. The LLM-CoT combines local models DeepSeek-r1:14b and Qwen2:7b with Ollama. The ML-LLM-CoT integrates a pre-trained Gaussian ML model with the LLM-based CoT framework. Our results show that during construction, ML-LLM-CoT is more efficient. It only has 2 points that require rethink and a total of 4 rethink times, while LLM-CoT has 5 points that need to be re-thought and 34 total rethink times. In predicting the solubility of 20 molecules with dissimilar structures, the number of molecules with a prediction deviation higher than 100\% for the Gaussian model, LLM-CoT, and ML-LLM-CoT is 7, 6, and 4 respectively. These results indicate that ML-LLM-CoT performs better in controlling the number of high-deviation molecules, optimizing the average deviation, and achieving a higher success rate in solubility judgment, providing a more reliable method for chemical engineering and molecular property prediction. This study breaks through the limitations of traditional methods and offers new solutions for rapid property prediction and process optimization in chemical engineering. |

This paper critically examines advancements in soft robotic technologies tailored for SAR applications, focusing on their unique capabilities in adaptability, safety, and efficiency. By leveraging bio-inspired designs, flexible materials, and advanced locomotion mechanisms, such as crawling, rolling, and shape morphing, soft robots demonstrate exceptional potential in disaster scenarios. However, significant barriers persist, including material durability, power inefficiency, sensor integration, and control complexity. This comprehensive review highlights the current state of soft robotics in SAR, discusses simulation methodologies and hardware validations, and introduces performance metrics essential for their evaluation. By bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical deployment, this study underscores the potential of soft robotic systems to revolutionize SAR missions and advocates for continued interdisciplinary innovation to overcome existing limitations. |

Slice discovery methods (SDMs) are prominent algorithmic approaches for finding such systematic weaknesses. They identify top-k semantically coherent slices/subsets of data where a DNN-under-test has low performance. For being directly useful, e.g., as evidences in a safety argumentation, slices should be aligned with human-understandable (safety-relevant) dimensions, which, for example, are defined by safety and domain experts as parts of the operational design domain (ODD). While straightforward for structured data, the lack of semantic metadata makes these investigations challenging for unstructured data. Therefore, we propose a complete workflow which combines contemporary foundation models with algorithms for combinatorial search that consider structured data and DNN errors for finding systematic weaknesses in images. In contrast to existing approaches, ours identifies weak slices that are in line with predefined human-understandable dimensions. As the workflow includes foundation models, its intermediate and final results may not always be exact. Therefore, we build into our workflow an approach to address the impact of noisy metadata. We evaluate our approach w.r.t. its quality on four popular computer vision datasets, including autonomous driving datasets like Cityscapes, BDD100k, and RailSem19, while using multiple state-of-the-art models as DNNs-under-test. |

On the one hand, asymptotically safe quantum gravity may provide a simple and predictive framework, thanks to a finite number of relevant parameters. On the other hand, a (sub-)set of intertwined swampland conjectures on the consistency of quantum gravity can be argued to be universal via effective field theory considerations. We answer whether some foundational features of these frameworks are compatible. This involves revisiting and refining several arguments (and loopholes) concerning the relation between field-theoretic descriptions of gravity and general swampland ideas. We identify the thermodynamics of black holes, spacetime topology change, and holography as the core aspects of this relation. We draw lessons on the features that a field theoretic description of gravity must (not) have to be consistent with fundamental principles underlying the swampland program, and on the universality of the latter. |

This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore, iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%). Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along with all relevant data, is available at GitHub. |

The neurosymbolic paradigm replaces stochastic layers with interpretable symbolic AI, enabling determinism. While promising, challenges like multisensor fusion, adaptability, and verification remain.

Ientilucci | Efficient segmentation of smoke plumes is crucial for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful emissions from activities like quarry blasts and wildfires. Accurate segmentation facilitates environmental impact assessments, timely interventions, and compliance with safety standards. However, existing models often face high computational demands and limited adaptability to diverse smoke appearances, restricting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, we introduce SmokeNet, a novel deep learning architecture that leverages multiscale convolutions and multiview linear attention mechanisms combined with layer-specific loss functions to handle the complex dynamics of diverse smoke plumes, ensuring efficient and accurate segmentation across varied environments. Additionally, we evaluate SmokeNet's performance and versatility using four datasets, including our quarry blast smoke dataset made available to the community. The results demonstrate that SmokeNet maintains a favorable balance between computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in environmental monitoring and safety management systems. By contributing a new dataset and offering an efficient segmentation model, SmokeNet advances smoke segmentation capabilities in diverse and challenging environments. |

A Study on Action-Guided Response Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12073v1) | Zhongyi Qiu, Hanjia Lyu et al. | Social media enables dynamic user engagement with trending topics, and recent research has explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) for response generation. While some studies investigate LLMs as agents for simulating user behavior on social media, their focus remains on practical viability and scalability rather than a deeper understanding of how well LLM aligns with human behavior. This paper analyzes LLMs' ability to simulate social media engagement through action guided response generation, where a model first predicts a user's most likely engagement action-retweet, quote, or rewrite-towards a trending post before generating a personalized response conditioned on the predicted action. We benchmark GPT-4o-mini, O1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1 in social media engagement simulation regarding a major societal event discussed on X. Our findings reveal that zero-shot LLMs underperform BERT in action prediction, while few-shot prompting initially degrades the prediction accuracy of LLMs with limited examples. However, in response generation, few-shot LLMs achieve stronger semantic alignment with ground truth posts. |

Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop. |
| 2025-02-17 | [PhysReason: A Comprehensive Benchmark towards Physics-Based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12054v1) | Xinyu Zhang, Yuxuan Dong et al. | Large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various domains, especially mathematics and logic reasoning. However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models. Our code and data will be published at https:/dxzxy12138.github.io/PhysReason. |

However, long CoT does not inherently guarantee safe outputs, potentially leading to harmful consequences such as the introduction of security vulnerabilities in code or the spread of misinformation. Current research on large language model (LLM) safety usually focuses on short-answer responses, overlooking the long CoT style outputs of LRMs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of LRM safety. First, we investigate safety evaluators calibrated against human annotations. Using our newly developed metrics, we thoroughly assess the safety of 12 state-of-the-art LRMs on StrongReject and WildJailbreak datasets. Our results show that LRMs are not safe compared to their reasoning advance. Further, we perform a fine-grained analysis of the reasoning trace and final answer. We find that three decoding strategies-ZeroThink, LessThink, and MoreThink-can improve model safety without additional training. However, these strategies either use constrained reasoning traces or incur high inference costs. To better strengthen LRM safety, we introduce SafeChain, the first-of-its-kind safety training dataset in CoT style. We fine-tune two LRMs with SafeChain, showing that it not only enhances model safety but also preserves performance across 6 reasoning benchmarks. |
| 2025-02-17 | [Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12018v1) | Fengwei Teng, Zhaoyang Yu et al. | Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a sequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable. These subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their current state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless transitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state. This iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching directly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions between question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6% F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4% and DeepSeek-R1 by 10.6%. The code will be available at https://github.com/qixucen/atom. |
| 2025-02-17 | [LIMR: Less is More for RL Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11886v1) | Xuefeng Li, Haoyang Zou et al. | In this paper, we ask: what truly determines the effectiveness of RL training data for enhancing language models' reasoning capabilities? While recent advances like o1, Deepseek R1, and Kimi1.5 demonstrate RL's potential, the lack of transparency about training data requirements has hindered systematic progress. Starting directly from base models without distillation, we challenge the assumption that scaling up RL training data inherently improves performance. we demonstrate that a strategically selected subset of just 1,389 samples can outperform the full 8,523-sample dataset. We introduce Learning Impact Measurement (LIM), an automated method to evaluate and prioritize training samples based on their alignment with model learning trajectories, enabling efficient resource utilization and scalable implementation. Our method achieves comparable or even superior performance using only 1,389 samples versus the full 8,523 samples dataset. Notably, while recent data-efficient approaches (e.g., LIMO and s1) show promise with 32B-scale models, we find it significantly underperforms at 7B-scale through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In contrast, our RL-based LIMR achieves 16.7% higher accuracy on AIME24 and outperforms LIMO and s1 by 13.0% and 22.2% on MATH500. These results fundamentally reshape our understanding of RL scaling in LLMs, demonstrating that precise sample selection, rather than data scale, may be the key to unlocking enhanced reasoning capabilities. For reproducible research and future innovation, we are open-sourcing LIMR, including implementation of LIM, training and evaluation code, curated datasets, and trained models at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMR. |
| 2025-02-17 | [Hypothesis-Driven Theory-of-Mind Reasoning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11881v1) | Hyunwoo Kim, Melanie Sclar et al. | Existing LLM reasoning methods have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, such as solving math and coding problems. However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o1 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains. |
| 2025-02-17 | [StructTransform: A Scalable Attack Surface for Safety-Aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11853v1) | Shehel Yoosuf, Temoor Ali et al. | In this work, we present a series of structure transformation attacks on LLM alignment, where we encode natural language intent using diverse syntax spaces, ranging from simple structure formats and basic query languages (e.g. SQL) to new novel spaces and syntaxes created entirely by LLMs. Our extensive evaluation shows that our simplest attacks can achieve close to 90% success rate, even on strict LLMs (such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using SOTA alignment mechanisms. We improve the attack performance further by using an adaptive scheme that combines structure transformations along with existing \textit{content transformations}, resulting in over 96% ASR with 0% refusals.   To generalize our attacks, we explore numerous structure formats, including syntaxes purely generated by LLMs. Our results indicate that such novel syntaxes are easy to generate and result in a high ASR, suggesting that defending against our attacks is not a straightforward process. Finally, we develop a benchmark and evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses against it, showing that most of them fail with 100% ASR. Our results show that existing safety alignment mostly relies on token-level patterns without recognizing harmful concepts, highlighting and motivating the need for serious research efforts in this direction. As a case study, we demonstrate how attackers can use our attack to easily generate a sample malware, and a corpus of fraudulent SMS messages, which perform well in bypassing detection. |

Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs. |

To enhance its reasoning abilities, we develop a reasoning-intensive dataset featuring challenging audio-visual questions with step-by-step solutions. We also propose process direct preference optimization (pDPO), which leverages contrastive step selection to achieve efficient step-level reward modelling tailored for multimodal inputs. Additionally, we introduce RivaBench, the first reasoning-intensive video understanding benchmark, featuring over 4,000 high-quality, expert-curated question-answer pairs across scenarios such as standup comedy, academic presentations, and synthetic video detection. video-SALMONN-o1 achieves 3-8% accuracy improvements over the LLaVA-OneVision baseline across different video reasoning benchmarks. Besides, pDPO achieves 6-8% improvements compared to the supervised fine-tuning model on RivaBench. Enhanced reasoning enables video-SALMONN-o1 zero-shot synthetic video detection capabilities. |

Thanks to the application of large language models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in this field. However, challenges such as model scalability, limited generation space, and coherence issues in SQL generation still persist. To address these issues, we propose SQL-o1, a Self-Reward-based heuristic search method designed to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs in SQL query generation. SQL-o1 combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for heuristic process-level search and constructs a Schema-Aware dataset to help the model better understand database schemas. Extensive experiments on the Bird and Spider datasets demonstrate that SQL-o1 improves execution accuracy by 10.8\% on the complex Bird dataset compared to the latest baseline methods, even outperforming GPT-4-based approaches. Additionally, SQL-o1 excels in few-shot learning scenarios and shows strong cross-model transferability. Our code is publicly available at:https://github.com/ShuaiLyu0110/SQL-o1. |

M. de Oliveira et al. | The renewed global interest in lunar exploration requires new orbital strategies to ensure flight safety which can benefit extended lunar missions and service a plethora of planned instruments in the lunar orbit and surface. We investigate here the equivalent fuel consumption cost to transfer from (to) a given orbit and enter (leave) at any point of an invariant manifold associated with a Lyapunov orbit around the Earth-Moon $L_1$ Lagrangian point using bi-impulsive maneuvers. Whereas solving this type of transfer is generally computationally expensive, we simulate here tens of millions of transfers orbits, for different times of flight, Jacobi constants and spatial location on the manifold. We are able to reduce computational cost by taking advantage of the efficient procedure given by the Theory of Functional Connections for solving boundary value problems, represented with special constraints created to the purposes of this work. We develop here the methodology for constructing these transfers, and apply it to find a low-cost transfer from an orbit around the Earth to a stable manifold and another low-cost transfer from an unstable manifold to an orbit around the Moon. In the end, we obtain an innovative Earth-to-Moon transfer that involves a gravity assist maneuver with the Moon and allows a long stationed stage at the Lyapunov orbit around $L_1$ which can be used for designing multi-purpose missions for extended periods of time with low fuel costs. This is paramount to optimize new exploration concepts. |

Current alignment approaches require high-quality annotations and significant training resources. This paper proposes a low-cost, tuning-free method using in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM alignment. Through an analysis of high-quality ICL demos, we identified style as a key factor influencing LLM alignment capabilities and explicitly restyled ICL exemplars based on this stylistic framework. Additionally, we combined the restyled demos to achieve a balance between the two conflicting aspects of LLM alignment--factuality and safety. We packaged the restyled examples as prompts to trigger few-shot learning, improving LLM alignment. Compared to the best baseline approach, with an average score of 5.00 as the maximum, our method achieves a maximum 0.10 increase on the Alpaca task (from 4.50 to 4.60), a 0.22 enhancement on the Just-eval benchmark (from 4.34 to 4.56), and a maximum improvement of 0.32 (from 3.53 to 3.85) on the MT-Bench dataset.

Existing defense mechanisms, such as safety fine-tuning and model editing, either require extensive parameter modifications or lack precision, leading to performance degradation on general tasks, which is unsuitable to post-deployment safety alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DELMAN (Dynamic Editing for LLMs JAilbreak DefeNse), a novel approach leveraging direct model editing for precise, dynamic protection against jailbreak attacks. DELMAN directly updates a minimal set of relevant parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving the model's utility. To avoid triggering a safe response in benign context, we incorporate KL-divergence regularization to ensure the updated model remains consistent with the original model when processing benign queries. Experimental results demonstrate that DELMAN outperforms baseline methods in mitigating jailbreak attacks while preserving the model's utility, and adapts seamlessly to new attack instances, providing a practical and efficient solution for post-deployment model protection. |

Existing methods often require retraining or modifications to pre-trained models, which is impractical for clinical applications. This study introduces a post-hoc normalizing flow-based approach that seamlessly integrates with pre-trained models. By leveraging normalizing flows, it estimates the likelihood of feature vectors extracted from pre-trained models, capturing semantically meaningful representations without relying on pixel-level statistics. The method was evaluated using the MedMNIST benchmark and a newly curated MedOOD dataset simulating clinically relevant distributional shifts. Performance was measured using standard OOD detection metrics (e.g., AUROC, FPR@95, AUPR_IN, AUPR_OUT), with statistical analyses comparing it against ten baseline methods. On MedMNIST, the proposed model achieved an AUROC of 93.80%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. On MedOOD, it achieved an AUROC of 84.61%, demonstrating superior performance against other methods. Its post-hoc nature ensures compatibility with existing clinical workflows, addressing the limitations of previous approaches. The model and code to build OOD datasets are available at https://github.com/dlotfi/MedOODFlow. |

Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as OpenAI-o1, have significantly broadened their applicability, particularly in complex problem-solving and logical inference. However, most existing LLMs struggle with notable limitations in handling graph combinatorial optimization (GCO) problems. To bridge this gap, we formally define the Optimal Thoughts Design (OTD) problem, including its state and action thought space. We then introduce a novel framework, GraphThought, designed to generate high-quality thought datasets for GCO problems. Leveraging these datasets, we fine-tune the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model to develop Llama-GT. Notably, despite its compact 8B-parameter architecture, Llama-GT matches the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on the GraphArena benchmark. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms both proprietary and open-source models, even rivaling specialized models like o1-mini. This work sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark while challenging the prevailing notion that model scale is the primary driver of reasoning capability. |

Runtime Enforcement (RE) is a lightweight method to formally ensure that some specified properties are satisfied over the executions of the system. Hence, there is recent interest in the RE of CPS. However, existing methods are not designed to tackle specifications suitable for the hybrid dynamics of CPS. With this in mind, we develop runtime enforcement of CPS using properties defined in Signal Temporal Logic (STL).   In this work, we aim to construct a runtime enforcer for a given STL formula to minimally modify a signal to satisfy the formula. To achieve this, the STL formula to be enforced is first translated into a timed transducer, while the signal to be corrected is encoded as timed words. We provide timed transducers for the temporal operators \emph{until} and \emph{release} noting that other temporal operators can be expressed using these two. Our approach enables effective enforcement of STL properties for CPS. A case study is provided to illustrate the approach and generate empirical evidence of its suitability for CPS. |

This paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on language complexity measurement tasks, through the computation of the LIX readability metric and Average Dependency Distance (ADD). Using Swedish high school and university-level essays, we evaluate the models' abilities to compute LIX scores and perform dependency parsing, comparing their results to established ground truths. Our findings reveal that while all models demonstrate some capacity for these tasks, ChatGPT-o1-mini performs most consistently, achieving the highest accuracy in both LIX computation and dependency parsing. Additionally, we observe a strong significant correlation -0.875 p 0.026 (N=6) between the models' accuracy in computing LIX and their overall performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. These results suggest that language complexity measurement abilities can serve as a noisy zero-shot proxies for assessing the general capabilities of LLMs, providing a practical method for model evaluation without the need for extensive benchmarking datasets. |

Unlike prior studies that focus solely on answer correctness, we rigorously analyze both final answers and solution steps to identify reasoning failures. Evaluating eight state-of-the-art models - including Mixtral, Llama, Gemini, GPT-4o, and OpenAI's o1 variants - we find that while newer models (e.g., o3-mini, deepseek-r1) achieve higher accuracy, all models exhibit errors in spatial reasoning, strategic planning, and arithmetic, sometimes producing correct answers through flawed logic. Common failure modes include unwarranted assumptions, over-reliance on numerical patterns, and difficulty translating physical intuition into mathematical steps. Manual analysis reveals that models struggle with problems requiring multi-step deduction or real-world knowledge, despite possessing broad mathematical knowledge. Our results underscore the importance of evaluating reasoning processes, not just answers, and caution against overestimating LLMs' problem-solving proficiency. The study highlights persistent gaps in LLMs' generalization abilities, emphasizing the need for targeted improvements in structured reasoning and constraint handling. |

However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness. |

This study examines: (1) how o1-Like LLMs perform in MMT tasks and (2) what factors influence their translation quality. We evaluate multiple o1-Like LLMs and compare them with traditional models like ChatGPT and GPT-4o. Results show that o1-Like LLMs establish new multilingual translation benchmarks, with DeepSeek-R1 surpassing GPT-4o in contextless tasks. They demonstrate strengths in historical and cultural translation but exhibit a tendency for rambling issues in Chinese-centric outputs. Further analysis reveals three key insights: (1) High inference costs and slower processing speeds make complex translation tasks more resource-intensive. (2) Translation quality improves with model size, enhancing commonsense reasoning and cultural translation. (3) The temperature parameter significantly impacts output quality-lower temperatures yield more stable and accurate translations, while higher temperatures reduce coherence and precision. |

Nevertheless, evaluating and optimizing complex reasoning processes remain significant challenges due to diverse policy distributions and the inherent limitations of human effort and accuracy. In this paper, we present AURORA, a novel automated framework for training universal process reward models (PRMs) using ensemble prompting and reverse verification. The framework employs a two-phase approach: First, it uses diverse prompting strategies and ensemble methods to perform automated annotation and evaluation of processes, ensuring robust assessments for reward learning. Second, it leverages practical reference answers for reverse verification, enhancing the model's ability to validate outputs and improving training accuracy. To assess the framework's performance, we extend beyond the existing ProcessBench benchmark by introducing UniversalBench, which evaluates reward predictions across full trajectories under diverse policy distribtion with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs.

Unlike LLM, the current safety alignment of VLMs is often achieved with post-hoc safety fine-tuning. However, these methods are less effective to white-box attacks. To address this, we propose $\textit{Adversary-aware DPO (ADPO)}$, a novel training framework that explicitly considers adversarial. $\textit{Adversary-aware DPO (ADPO)}$ integrates adversarial training into DPO to enhance the safety alignment of VLMs under worst-case adversarial perturbations. $\textit{ADPO}$ introduces two key components: (1) an adversarial-trained reference model that generates human-preferred responses under worst-case perturbations, and (2) an adversarial-aware DPO loss that generates winner-loser pairs accounting for adversarial distortions. By combining these innovations, $\textit{ADPO}$ ensures that VLMs remain robust and reliable even in the presence of sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textit{ADPO}$ outperforms baselines in the safety alignment and general utility of VLMs. |

These LLMs demonstrate strong problem-solving capabilities and adaptability to multifaceted scenarios. However, their use as agents also introduces significant risks, including task-specific risks, which are identified by the agent administrator based on the specific task requirements and constraints, and systemic risks, which stem from vulnerabilities in their design or interactions, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of information and triggering security risks. Existing defense agencies fail to adaptively and effectively mitigate these risks. In this paper, we propose AGrail, a lifelong agent guardrail to enhance LLM agent safety, which features adaptive safety check generation, effective safety check optimization, and tool compatibility and flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGrail not only achieves strong performance against task-specific and system risks but also exhibits transferability across different LLM agents' tasks. |

Thus, it is important to ensure that such rankings are fair. Under the goal of equal opportunity, attention allocated to an individual on a ranking interface should be proportional to their relevance across search queries. In this work, we examine amortized fair ranking -- where relevance and attention are cumulated over a sequence of user queries to make fair ranking more feasible in practice. Unlike prior methods that operate on expected amortized attention for each individual, we define new divergence-based measures for attention distribution-based fairness in ranking (DistFaiR), characterizing unfairness as the divergence between the distribution of attention and relevance corresponding to an individual over time. This allows us to propose new definitions of unfairness, which are more reliable at test time. Second, we prove that group fairness is upper-bounded by individual fairness under this definition for a useful class of divergence measures, and experimentally show that maximizing individual fairness through an integer linear programming-based optimization is often beneficial to group fairness. Lastly, we find that prior research in amortized fair ranking ignores critical information about queries, potentially leading to a fairwashing risk in practice by making rankings appear more fair than they actually are. |

Detecting and filtering such unsafe training data is essential for trustworthy model development. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches typically rely on training moderation classifiers which requires significant computational overhead and are limited to predefined taxonomies, making them less adaptable to evolving safety concerns. Moreover, these classifiers lack insight into the training process, limiting their effectiveness in filtering unsafe data. To address these limitations, we propose DABUF, leveraging data attribution to detect and filter unsafe training data by attributing harmful model outputs to influential training data points. DABUF enables flexible identification of various unsafe data types without predefined taxonomies. However, in practice, model outputs can be complex with combined safe linguistic features and unsafe content, leading to reduced attribution accuracy. In such cases, DABUF will integrate moderation classifiers to identify a minimal subset of unsafe training data for targeted attribution (such as jailbreak). When model outputs are relatively straightforward, DABUF uses model outputs directly as the attribution targets. We evaluate the performance on two different tasks: in filtering jailbreaking training data and in identifying and mitigating gender bias. DABUF outperforms SOTA approaches by up to 7.5\% in detection AUPRC in jailbreaking scenarios, and 44.1\% in detecting gender bias. Moreover, retraining on DABUF-filtered data leads to higher model safety across experiments, underscoring its versatility in addressing a broad spectrum of unsafe data issues. |

Current jailbreak attack methods mainly focus on discrete prompt manipulations targeting closed-source LLMs, relying on manually crafted prompt templates and persuasion rules. However, as the capabilities of open-source LLMs improve, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly crucial. In such an environment, the accessibility of model parameters and gradient information by potential attackers exacerbates the severity of jailbreak threats. To address this research gap, we propose a novel \underline{C}ontext-\underline{C}oherent \underline{J}ailbreak \underline{A}ttack (CCJA). We define jailbreak attacks as an optimization problem within the embedding space of masked language models. Through combinatorial optimization, we effectively balance the jailbreak attack success rate with semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations show that our method not only maintains semantic consistency but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness. Additionally, by integrating semantically coherent jailbreak prompts generated by our method into widely used black-box methodologies, we observe a notable enhancement in their success rates when targeting closed-source commercial LLMs. This highlights the security threat posed by open-source LLMs to commercial counterparts. We will open-source our code if the paper is accepted. |

While widely studied, existing systems often adopt a leader-follower model, limiting robot autonomy to some extent. Besides, a human is required to directly participate in the motion control of robots through teleoperation, which significantly burdens the operator. To alleviate these two issues, we propose a layered shared control computing framework using human-influenced guiding vector fields (HI-GVF) for human-robot collaboration. HI-GVF guides the multi-robot system along a desired path specified by the human. Then, an intention field is designed to merge the human and robot intentions, accelerating the propagation of the human intention within the multi-robot system. Moreover, we give the stability analysis of the proposed model and use collision avoidance based on safety barrier certificates to fine-tune the velocity. Eventually, considering the firefighting task as an example scenario, we conduct simulations and experiments using multiple human-robot interfaces (brain-computer interface, myoelectric wristband, eye-tracking), and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach boosts the effectiveness and performance of the task. |

We systematically analyze SAE for interpretable feature extraction from LLMs in safety-critical classification tasks. Our framework evaluates (1) model-layer selection and scaling properties, (2) SAE architectural configurations, including width and pooling strategies, and (3) the effect of binarizing continuous SAE activations. SAE-derived features achieve macro F1 > 0.8, outperforming hidden-state and BoW baselines while demonstrating cross-model transfer from Gemma 2 2B to 9B-IT models. These features generalize in a zero-shot manner to cross-lingual toxicity detection and visual classification tasks. Our analysis highlights the significant impact of pooling strategies and binarization thresholds, showing that binarization offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature selection while maintaining or improving performance. These findings establish new best practices for SAE-based interpretability and enable scalable, transparent deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

In particular, multimodal disinformation, i.e., online posts-articles that contain images and texts with fabricated information are specially designed to deceive. While existing AI safety benchmarks primarily address bias and toxicity, multimodal disinformation detection remains largely underexplored. To address this challenge, we present the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark VLDBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for detecting disinformation across both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text and image) content, comprising 31,000} news article-image pairs, spanning 13 distinct categories, for robust evaluation. VLDBench features a rigorous semi-automated data curation pipeline, with 22 domain experts dedicating 300 plus hours} to annotation, achieving a strong inter-annotator agreement (Cohen kappa = 0.78). We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that integrating textual and visual cues in multimodal news posts improves disinformation detection accuracy by 5 - 35 % compared to unimodal models. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks such as the EU AI Act, NIST guidelines, and the MIT AI Risk Repository 2024, VLDBench is expected to become a benchmark for detecting disinformation in online multi-modal contents. Our code and data will be publicly available. |

For this critical selection stage, rule-based scoring mechanisms are particularly appealing as they can explicitly encode driving preferences, safety constraints, and traffic regulations in a formalized, human-understandable format. However, manually crafting these scoring rules presents significant challenges: the rules often contain complex interdependencies, require careful parameter tuning, and may not fully capture the nuances present in real-world driving data. This work introduces FLoRA, a novel framework that bridges this gap by learning interpretable scoring rules represented in temporal logic. Our method features a learnable logic structure that captures nuanced relationships across diverse driving scenarios, optimizing both rules and parameters directly from real-world driving demonstrations collected in NuPlan. Our approach effectively learns to evaluate driving behavior even though the training data only contains positive examples (successful driving demonstrations). Evaluations in closed-loop planning simulations demonstrate that our learned scoring rules outperform existing techniques, including expert-designed rules and neural network scoring models, while maintaining interpretability. This work introduces a data-driven approach to enhance the scoring mechanism in autonomous driving systems, designed as a plug-in module to seamlessly integrate with various trajectory proposers.

Traffic monitoring models must comprehensively understand dynamic urban conditions and provide an intuitive user interface for effective management. This research leverages the LLaVA visual grounding multimodal large language model (LLM) for traffic monitoring tasks on the real-time Quanser Interactive Lab simulation platform, covering scenarios like intersections, congestion, and collisions. Cameras placed at multiple urban locations collect real-time images from the simulation, which are fed into the LLaVA model with queries for analysis. An instance segmentation model integrated into the cameras highlights key elements such as vehicles and pedestrians, enhancing training and throughput. The system achieves 84.3% accuracy in recognizing vehicle locations and 76.4% in determining steering direction, outperforming traditional models. |

Moreover, fusing information from multiple cameras at the image feature level is difficult because of different view angles. Further, the necessity for practical implementation and compatibility with existing traffic infrastructure compounds these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Bird's-Eye-View road occupancy detection framework that leverages multiple roadside cameras to overcome the aforementioned limitations. To facilitate the framework's development and evaluation, a synthetic dataset featuring diverse scenes and varying camera configurations is generated using the CARLA simulator. A late fusion and three early fusion methods were implemented within the proposed framework, with performance further enhanced by integrating backgrounds. Extensive evaluations were conducted to analyze the impact of multi-camera inputs and varying BEV occupancy map sizes on model performance. Additionally, a real-world data collection pipeline was developed to assess the model's ability to generalize to real-world environments. The sim-to-real capabilities of the model were evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot fine-tuning, demonstrating its potential for practical application. This research aims to advance perception systems in traffic monitoring, contributing to improved traffic management, operational efficiency, and road safety. |

We introduce Soteria, a lightweight yet powerful strategy that locates and minimally adjusts the "functional heads" most responsible for harmful content generation in each language. By altering only a fraction of parameters, Soteria drastically reduces policy violations without sacrificing overall model performance, even in low-resource settings. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we also present XThreatBench, a specialized multilingual dataset capturing fine-grained harmful behaviors drawn from real policy guidelines. Experiments with leading open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama, Qwen, Mistral) show that Soteria consistently improves safety metrics across high-, mid-, and low-resource languages. These findings highlight a promising path toward scalable, linguistically attuned, and ethically aligned LLMs worldwide. |

Despite their potential to enhance learning, there is a lack of standardized frameworks to mitigate these risks. Through a systematic literature review, we identify key parental and empirical concerns, including toxicity and ethical breaches in AI outputs. Moreover, to address these issues, this paper proposes a protection framework for safe Child-LLM interaction, incorporating metrics for content safety, behavioral ethics, and cultural sensitivity. The framework provides practical tools for evaluating LLM safety, offering guidance for developers, policymakers, and educators to ensure responsible AI deployment for children. |

However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe-a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness-prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning-but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area. All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research. |

However, detailed evaluations from the perspective of real-world applications are lacking, making it challenging for users to select the most suitable DeepSeek models for their specific needs. To address this gap, we evaluate the DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama series on A-Eval, an application-driven benchmark. By comparing original instruction-tuned models with their distilled counterparts, we analyze how reasoning enhancements impact performance across diverse practical tasks. Our results show that reasoning-enhanced models, while generally powerful, do not universally outperform across all tasks, with performance gains varying significantly across tasks and models. To further assist users in model selection, we quantify the capability boundary of DeepSeek models through performance tier classifications and intuitive line charts. Specific examples provide actionable insights to help users select and deploy the most cost-effective DeepSeek models, ensuring optimal performance and resource efficiency in real-world applications. |

Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. |

Therefore, many GPU-accelerated cryptographic schemes have been proposed to improve the performance of HE. However, these methods often require complex modifications tailored to specific algorithms and are tightly coupled with specific GPU and operating systems. It is interesting to ask how to generally offer more practical GPU-accelerated cryptographic algorithm implementations. Given the powerful code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we aim to explore their potential to automatically generate practical GPU-friendly algorithm code using CPU-friendly code. In this paper, we focus on number theoretic transform (NTT) -- the core mechanism of HE. We first develop and optimize a GPU-friendly NTT (GNTT) family that exploits PyTorch's fast matrix computation and precomputation, achieving an approximately 62x speedup -- a significant boost over existing ones. Then we explore GPU-friendly code generation using various LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1 and o3-mini. We discover many interesting findings throughout the process. For instance, somewhat surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that DeepSeek-R1 significantly outperforms OpenAI o3-mini and o1, but still cannot beat our optimized protocol. The findings provide valuable insights for turbocharging PPML and enhancing code generation capabilities of LLMs. Codes are available at: https://github.com/LMPC-Lab/GenGPUCrypto. |

However, they frequently generate unverified outputs, which compromises their reliability in critical applications. In this study, we propose an innovative framework that combines structured biomedical knowledge with LLMs through a retrieval-augmented generation technique. Our system develops a thorough knowledge graph by identifying and refining causal relationships and named entities from medical abstracts related to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Using a vector-based retrieval process and a locally deployed language model, our framework produces responses that are both contextually relevant and verifiable, with direct references to clinical evidence. Experimental results show that this method notably decreases hallucinations, enhances factual precision, and improves the clarity of generated responses, providing a robust solution for advanced biomedical chatbot applications. |

In this paper, we propose \textit{Talk Structurally, Act Hierarchically (TalkHier)}, a novel framework that introduces a structured communication protocol for context-rich exchanges and a hierarchical refinement system to address issues such as incorrect outputs, falsehoods, and biases. \textit{TalkHier} surpasses various types of SoTA, including inference scaling model (OpenAI-o1), open-source multi-agent models (e.g., AgentVerse), and majority voting strategies on current LLM and single-agent baselines (e.g., ReAct, GPT4o), across diverse tasks, including open-domain question answering, domain-specific selective questioning, and practical advertisement text generation. These results highlight its potential to set a new standard for LLM-MA systems, paving the way for more effective, adaptable, and collaborative multi-agent frameworks.

Without additional training, MoTE enables meaningful and focused behavior changes in LLMs on-the-fly during inference time.   By analyzing the digital LLM brain of DeepSeek-R1 using a technique we dub 'functional Token Resonance Imaging' (fTRI) - inspired by fMRI and using prompts designed to elicit specific behavior (e.g., 'What happened {time}{place}?') - we empirically identify distinctive experts associated with behaviors like refusal responses.   Using MoTE we are able to intervene and control such specific behavior. We switched off the top 10 most refusal-relevant experts (0.07% of R1's 14,848 routed experts), achieving a 52% refusal reduction on sensitive reference prompts without performance degradation on MT-Bench. Random expert deactivation resulted in smaller behavioral shifts with increased noise, whereas forced expert activation led to significantly higher refusal rates.   Our approach shares similarities with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in terms of explainability and steerability. Unlike SAEs, MoTE does not require large training efforts, as within MoEs with a vast number of experts, specialization already emerged naturally during pretraining.   Our findings suggest that significant functional mechanisms in Mixture-of-Experts architectures can at least partially be localized in a small number of specific experts, rather than being distributed throughout the model's weights. Expert subgroups can be tuned to trigger significant behavior variations, providing insights into the inner workings of LLMs. |

Current benchmarks primarily concentrate on single-turn dialogues or a single jailbreak attack method to assess the safety. Additionally, these benchmarks have not taken into account the LLM's capability of identifying and handling unsafe information in detail. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained benchmark SafeDialBench for evaluating the safety of LLMs across various jailbreak attacks in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, we design a two-tier hierarchical safety taxonomy that considers 6 safety dimensions and generates more than 4000 multi-turn dialogues in both Chinese and English under 22 dialogue scenarios. We employ 7 jailbreak attack strategies, such as reference attack and purpose reverse, to enhance the dataset quality for dialogue generation. Notably, we construct an innovative assessment framework of LLMs, measuring capabilities in detecting, and handling unsafe information and maintaining consistency when facing jailbreak attacks. Experimental results across 17 LLMs reveal that Yi-34B-Chat and GLM4-9B-Chat demonstrate superior safety performance, while Llama3.1-8B-Instruct and o3-mini exhibit safety vulnerabilities. |
| 2025-02-16 | [Rewrite to Jailbreak: Discover Learnable and Transferable Implicit Harmfulness Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11084v1) | Yuting Huang, Chengyuan Liu et al. | As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in various domains, the safety of LLMs is increasingly attracting attention to avoid their powerful capabilities being misused. Existing jailbreak methods create a forced instruction-following scenario, or search adversarial prompts with prefix or suffix tokens to achieve a specific representation manually or automatically. However, they suffer from low efficiency and explicit jailbreak patterns, far from the real deployment of mass attacks to LLMs. In this paper, we point out that simply rewriting the original instruction can achieve a jailbreak, and we find that this rewriting approach is learnable and transferable. We propose the Rewrite to Jailbreak (R2J) approach, a transferable black-box jailbreak method to attack LLMs by iteratively exploring the weakness of the LLMs and automatically improving the attacking strategy. The jailbreak is more efficient and hard to identify since no additional features are introduced. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of R2J, and we find that the jailbreak is also transferable to multiple datasets and various types of models with only a few queries. We hope our work motivates further investigation of LLM safety. |

Although deep learning has significantly advanced weather prediction, current methods face critical limitations: (i) they often struggle to capture both dynamic temporal dependencies and short-term abrupt changes, making extreme weather modeling difficult; (ii) they incur high computational costs due to extensive training and resource requirements; (iii) they have limited adaptability to multi-scale frequencies, leading to challenges when separating global trends from local fluctuations. To address these issues, we propose ClimateLLM, a foundation model for weather forecasting. It captures spatiotemporal dependencies via a cross-temporal and cross-spatial collaborative modeling framework that integrates Fourier-based frequency decomposition with Large Language Models (LLMs) to strengthen spatial and temporal modeling. Our framework uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism that adaptively processes different frequency components, enabling efficient handling of both global signals and localized extreme events. In addition, we introduce a cross-temporal and cross-spatial dynamic prompting mechanism, allowing LLMs to incorporate meteorological patterns across multiple scales effectively. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ClimateLLM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and efficiency, as a scalable solution for global weather forecasting. |

However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems. |
| 2025-02-16 | [Reasoning-Augmented Conversation for Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11054v2) | Zonghao Ying, Deyue Zhang et al. | Multi-turn jailbreak attacks simulate real-world human interactions by engaging large language models (LLMs) in iterative dialogues, exposing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing methods often struggle to balance semantic coherence with attack effectiveness, resulting in either benign semantic drift or ineffective detection evasion. To address this challenge, we propose Reasoning-Augmented Conversation, a novel multi-turn jailbreak framework that reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and leverages LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities to compromise safety alignment. Specifically, we introduce an attack state machine framework to systematically model problem translation and iterative reasoning, ensuring coherent query generation across multiple turns. Building on this framework, we design gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules to preserve attack semantics, enhance effectiveness, and sustain reasoning-driven attack progression. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness in complex conversational scenarios, with attack success rates (ASRs) increasing by up to 96%. Notably, our approach achieves ASRs of 82% and 92% against leading commercial models, OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, underscoring its potency. We release our code at https://github.com/NY1024/RACE to facilitate further research in this critical domain. |
| 2025-02-16 | [Prompt Inject Detection with Generative Explanation as an Investigative Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11006v1) | Jonathan Pan, Swee Liang Wong et al. | Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial prompt based injects. These injects could jailbreak or exploit vulnerabilities within these models with explicit prompt requests leading to undesired responses. In the context of investigating prompt injects, the challenge is the sheer volume of input prompts involved that are likely to be largely benign. This investigative challenge is further complicated by the semantics and subjectivity of the input prompts involved in the LLM conversation with its user and the context of the environment to which the conversation is being carried out. Hence, the challenge for AI security investigators would be two-fold. The first is to identify adversarial prompt injects and then to assess whether the input prompt is contextually benign or adversarial. For the first step, this could be done using existing AI security solutions like guardrails to detect and protect the LLMs. Guardrails have been developed using a variety of approaches. A popular approach is to use signature based. Another popular approach to develop AI models to classify such prompts include the use of NLP based models like a language model. However, in the context of conducting an AI security investigation of prompt injects, these guardrails lack the ability to aid investigators in triaging or assessing the identified input prompts. In this applied research exploration, we explore the use of a text generation capabilities of LLM to detect prompt injects and generate explanation for its detections to aid AI security investigators in assessing and triaging of such prompt inject detections. The practical benefit of such a tool is to ease the task of conducting investigation into prompt injects. |

However, key factors such as battery power consumption and stepping noise are often inaccurately modeled or missing in common simulators, leaving these aspects poorly optimized or unaddressed by current sim-to-real methods. Hand-designed proxies, such as mechanical power and foot contact forces, have been used to address these challenges but are often problem-specific and inaccurate.   In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for fine-tuning locomotion policies, targeting these hard-to-simulate objectives. Our framework leverages real-world data to model these objectives and incorporates the learned model into simulation for policy improvement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on power saving for quadruped locomotion, achieving a significant 24-28\% net reduction in total power consumption from the battery pack at various speeds. In essence, our approach offers a versatile solution for optimizing hard-to-simulate objectives in quadruped locomotion, providing an easy-to-adapt paradigm for continual improving with real-world knowledge.

| 2025-02-15 | [Fundamental Principles of Linguistic Structure are Not Represented by o3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10934v1) | Elliot Murphy, Evelina Leivada et al. | A core component of a successful artificial general intelligence would be the rapid creation and manipulation of grounded compositional abstractions and the demonstration of expertise in the family of recursive hierarchical syntactic objects necessary for the creative use of human language. We evaluated the recently released o3 model (OpenAI; o3-mini-high) and discovered that while it succeeds on some basic linguistic tests relying on linear, surface statistics (e.g., the Strawberry Test), it fails to generalize basic phrase structure rules; it fails with comparative sentences involving semantically illegal cardinality comparisons ('Escher sentences'); its fails to correctly rate and explain acceptability dynamics; and it fails to distinguish between instructions to generate unacceptable semantic vs. unacceptable syntactic outputs. When tasked with generating simple violations of grammatical rules, it is seemingly incapable of representing multiple parses to evaluate against various possible semantic interpretations. In stark contrast to many recent claims that artificial language models are on the verge of replacing the field of linguistics, our results suggest not only that deep learning is hitting a wall with respect to compositionality (Marcus 2022), but that it is hitting [a [stubbornly [resilient wall]]] that cannot readily be surmounted to reach human-like compositional reasoning simply through more compute. |
